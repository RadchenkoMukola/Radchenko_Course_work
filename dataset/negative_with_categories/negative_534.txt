"we went last night saturday night to p.f.chang located at the kierlands in scottsdale. terrible experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then i ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . after a long wait my food came so salty that i could not even eat and as much as i hate to complain but i had to let the waiter know so he went to get me one with less salt. my husband's dish was ok. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. i feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. very bad experience. our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
