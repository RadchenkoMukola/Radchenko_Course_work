"eh this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a saturday night.bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. tip: if you sit behind the taps no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. when we moved seats we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. it wasn't all that busy either. most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. it seems that bar louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. maybe i'm just salty about the wait.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
