"i've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long. i remember the great crab legs i had years ago. i finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed.the service was great. we sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. i guess my main concern was the food quality. i ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. both were not unique in flavor or presentation. it was as if i made it in my own kitchen. my boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.i do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. and with all due respect to owners i think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics. especially since other key hotels are more pleasing to the eye. this should be vital to one of the best hotels in the city! i'd like to return someday to give it another go. we shall see.p.s. invest in better wine glasses. ugly. ugly. ugly.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
