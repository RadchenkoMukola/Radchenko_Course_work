"so this is a pittsburgh instiitution??  am so underwhelmed.  after waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches) they came out cold - and i'm not just talking about the meat lettuce tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  what a disappointment.  head to dibellas - much better service subs and sandwiches.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
