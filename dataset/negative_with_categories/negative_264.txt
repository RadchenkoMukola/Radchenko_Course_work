"serviceable upscale chain seafood spot with both traditional dishes and sushi.  yes it's expensive but it's one of the few spots open late downtown.   the sashimi was pleasant and it's hard to screw up oysters and seafood pasta.   our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations.the service is on par with your local crap-on-the-wall chain restaurant so don't expect too much.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
