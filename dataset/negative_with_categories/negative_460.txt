"meh. at best. so i went to bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. i started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( i know. i know. i am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix. i also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! iceberg lettuce croutons cucumbers and dry swordfish. lame. my dad got a meatball casserole which is something i would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me let alone as a package deal.  this meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. my sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce croutons cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. i guess pizza is what bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  pro: spicy bloody marys decent pizza cute waiter wide beer selectioncon: bland salads noodleless noodle soups not many healthy options no dinner entrees besides pasta",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
