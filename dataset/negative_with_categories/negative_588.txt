"the only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  i want to like this place so badly i keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.one year i took my father here for his birthday.  i don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the only reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  she forgot my dad's food order.  she brought out mine but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  the manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  then when they brought my dad's steak out the waitress dropped it (i felt bad for her) and apparently that was their last steak.  i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n park.the second time i came back the service was equally as terrible but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  seriously attacked by wasps.  my friend got stung.another time i'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  when we showed up it was like i'd never called.the last time i was there it was ok but after being attacked by wasps my friend and i opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.the service here sucks.  getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  it just sucks here.but the atmosphere is fantastic!  when your waitress comes ot hte table just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
