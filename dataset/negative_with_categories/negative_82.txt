"i was very disappointed with my meal here. i expected way more from lidia's. as a regular viewer of the show i was expecting fresh / rustic italian meals. what i ended up with was stuffed pasta that i'm 95% sure was reheated in a microwave bland mains and slow and inattentive service. the only highlight of the meal was the bread which was the only fresh ingredient used in the entire meal.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
