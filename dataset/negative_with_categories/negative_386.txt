"i'm not a mean reviewer if you look at the other places i've reviewed but this was just so so so disappointing. the shanghai style merlin was very poorly done. the meat was extremely bland with very little seasoning. i have a very low sodium tolerance and yet i still found this fish to be made too bland. the rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as i took my first bite. i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. it wasn't the same. the whole dish was a fail and i don't think i am ever coming back again :(",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
