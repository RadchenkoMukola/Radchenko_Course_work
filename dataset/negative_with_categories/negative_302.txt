"our terrible experience began with a 45 minute wait only to find half the tables empty and the table behind us being consoled by the manager after their own bad experience. we hopped this was a one off and not typical. our waiter was prompt but very aloof but we all have off days. the food was mostly bland and flavorless to the point we could not finish it.  this is where things took a turn for the worse as our order was being boxed up it fell on the floor. despite our insistence we did not want another the overcompensating manager brought it anyway. we passed it on to the party behind us maybe they took it home and added some seasoning it needs it. avoid this place at all costs!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
