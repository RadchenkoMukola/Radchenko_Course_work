"woulda been a 1 star review if not for our cute & courteous waitress.that said: yuck!   this was my second supremely dissapointing primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  i guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  bleh!  on my first primanti experience i ordered a corned beef sandwich as it shoud be no fries or coleslaw on it.  so i was served 2 slices of bread and about 1.5 slices of corned beef.  what a rip off.  2nd experience today equally as awful.  but as i said... waitstaff was great.  i ordered a pitts-burger with coleslaw and fries on the side.  seriously the quality of the burger i was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.  i guess you really see what their overpriced crappy sandwiches are truly made of when you strip off the fries & coleslaw.  their fries are also soggy and gross.  not a whole lot goin' on here except for cutie/attentive waitresses.  if you want a decent giant-sized sandwich and a real pgh experience go to peppi's.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
