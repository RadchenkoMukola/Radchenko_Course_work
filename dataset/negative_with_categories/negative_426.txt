"i went here on a saturday night with a few friends.  they had  a dj so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  i'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering i had never been in this place before i was taking a chance.  for those that know me i'm not the gambling kind.  but i thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like i'd be going broke.  the music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  it wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.  am i glad i checked this place out - sure but have i been to better dance clubs/bars - yes.  if you're in the area and looking for something to do then check it out but i wouldn't make a special trip to go here.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
