"morton's was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in america often emulated by others.  great they were with superb steaks outstanding service and old club style ambiance. this was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. landry's who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own morton's too. morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. on my last visit changes were visible. some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. the menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. gone is the famous gm bill. bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. one of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.i just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in america.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
