"i don't frequent bar louie and i really don't plan to change that any time soon. i've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and i just haven't been super impressed by the place.the food has been decent - a few years back i splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it glutton that i am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never wowed me. and while i enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often the problem is that things are way overpriced here. even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly not to mention that i think most of the drinks i personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount which is disappointing. once i stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. not even a large one either! sorry but i find that to be kind of ridiculous especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.still the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind if i could hear myself think when i eat here. but good lord they're just so loud! i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. not cool bar louie. not cool.so while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the waterfront i don't expect to be back in any time soon.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
