"service was bad. server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. we didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. she did take one of our cups to refill it sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. highly disappointing philly cheesesteak!! the meat in it is that of a frozen salisbury steak tv dinner!! french fries were good.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
