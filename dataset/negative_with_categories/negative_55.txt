"stopped in before a show at heinz hall.  it was not crowded but the waiter was almost useless.  he did not know the beer list drinks went unfilled etc.  plus i was served teriyaki fajitas.  that's right these were the oddest fajitas i have ever been served.  the taste was ok but it is not what i expect fajitas to be.  that said my wife's reuben and son's fish and chips were ok.  overall it was just ok food served by an incompetent waiter.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
