"came with my bf we started with the crab artichoke dip. it was very greasy and had virtually no crab. the wedge salad was good and crisp. i had the hazelnut crusted chicken. this has to be one of the worst dishes i've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. to finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
