"if you like the olive garden you'll love lidia's!  we were a party of two on a sunday night -- the restaurant was moderately busy.  our server was a bit of a space cadet.  we had to stop another waiter to ask for more water...i was never offered a refill on my diet coke (which sat empty for over 30 minutes).the salmon was very good but drenched in so much olive oil and garlic that an oil slick was left on the plate at the end of the meal.  the pasta tasting was....kind of weird.  one of the selections tasted like feet the other tasted like something i could make at home with a bottle of prego.  the best was a mushroom ravioli in olive oil -- but there was so much oil (see a theme?) i had to scrape it off before eating.long story short we passed on dessert.   the food was adequate the service was sub-par and it was just kind of a meh experience.i won't go back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
