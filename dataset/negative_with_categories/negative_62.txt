"i really really wanted to like this restaurant. hip quirky vegetarian/vegan. lots of owls and kitschy deco. i eat meat occasionally but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit and thought this would be a great choice. what's not to love right? well for starters the service. our server was really nice and had lots of reviews suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. plus even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. i'm not really a messy eater but come on!maybe part of the problem was expectations? we kicked things off with the firesticks appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. after that our orders (i had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? strangely spiced? i feel like the bar was set high with the app and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness and my dining companions agreed. i also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese and it was awful. you know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? well it was exactly that with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. really. i should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. learn from my mistake.we had planned to order milkshakes too but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. for $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake we decided to hit the milkshake factory on east carson instead.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
