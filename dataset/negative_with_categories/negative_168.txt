"we were in pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on don campiti's pizza. urban spoon rated 91% favorite. this pizza is not good. honestly it tastes like geno's frozen pizza from the grocery store. the pepperoni was very good. the crust was super thin and tasted like a salteen cracker. i've had much better pizza and will be exploring other options next time i'm in the burg.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
