"this place had horrible service. i waited (sitting at the bar non-the-less) for about 10 minutes before the loser bartender got me a drink and a menu. the food was weak i got a caesar salad and the wild bore stuffed ravioli. i was horrible. it was like they took some pulled pork and just stuffed a spoonful in a ravioli. i will not return too many other better restaurants are in town to waste your time on this one.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
