"not impressed by this restaurant.  ordered the pasta trio which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as all you can eat.  the staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  if i wanted all you can eat i would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  the pasta was cold when served.  the frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  i would not recommend nor would i ever return.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
