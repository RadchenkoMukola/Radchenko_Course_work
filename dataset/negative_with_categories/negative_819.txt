"first i would like to say the pasta too of old had good food this was just average.  the italian and mushroom steak hoagies weren't that great.  the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun.  the pizza wasn't that good either.  the prices are higher than the food was good. $6.25 for 7 italian and $7.50 for 7 mushroom steak. so not worth it but i guess they figure they can get from the people who work at the hospital and with all the new housing going up.  i will not get anything from there again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
