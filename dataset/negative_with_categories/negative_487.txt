"think chuck e. cheese for adults.  skee ball video games pool tables.  clean environment.  good fun.unfortunately i went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  i ended up settling for spinach dip.  sadly they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  blahhhh.  trying to get something healthy i ordered the apple pecan salad.  i swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  i could barely eat the salad.  too sweet.my mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  the steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried again!  yowzer!  artery clogger for sure.  i like the atmosphere.  i like the bar area.  perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
