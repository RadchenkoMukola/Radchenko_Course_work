"last weekend my mother and i headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from penn mac - veggies at stans - needed some new spices from penzeys for a chili i was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.we parked in front of roland's and see the sign: famous for lobster rolls and bloody mary's!perfect. my mother got the lobster roll which she said was 'good'. the bread from mancini's was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was mancini's bread. i had the lobster roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty no doubt  i mean lobster is just - good. for the price though not sure that i got enough bang for my buck. the salad was something i could have picked up at get-go in the pre-made section. i just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. i couldn't even drink my bloody mary (this is a rare affair) way too much horseradish and i often like horseradish in my bloodies!and it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. so needless to say not the best experience.talk about false advertisement...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
