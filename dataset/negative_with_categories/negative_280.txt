"i walked into sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. i don't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm. the bread was just sliced supermarket bread. i hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. don't waste your time",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
