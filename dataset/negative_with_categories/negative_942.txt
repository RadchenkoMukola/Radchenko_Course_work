"the service was lackluster. coffee was warm but delicious. limited to one cup apparently as the waitress never offered a second.daughter had sweet and sour shrimp. wife had spicy chicken. i had wonton soup. dumplings as an appetizer for the table. all arrived warm. the brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. also dry as sand. i guess that is how they serve it.the base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. i had expected them to be more diverse. in all expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. i'd rather have the local chinese cuisine which more flavorful and much less expensive.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
