"we ate at primanti bros based on the reviews on yelp hoping to get a real taste of pittsburgh. what i ordered was a sandwich labeled pittsburgher cheese steak. what i got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat cole slaw and mediocre fries on white bread. the sandwich was very small but i only ate 1/2 of it anyway and i have a pretty big appetite. i recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.i was truly shocked. that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school. we would have been much better off at burger king. luckily we had a nice lunch at salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
