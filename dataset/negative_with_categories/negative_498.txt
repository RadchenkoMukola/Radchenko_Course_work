"my experience here was not good my family and i were seated all the way in the back of the resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. we were the only african americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . the waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor i wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
