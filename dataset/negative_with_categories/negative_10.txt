"this can be summed up as follows: for greek food go to salonika directly across the street. this place is below par in just about every way. the prices are not high but the servers seem more like salesmen in pressuring you to add dessert etc. (at lunch?). i haven't been impressed by the food after numerous tries and the atmosphere is dated and dingy. i would much rather go across the street at a place with no pretensions (counter service) and pay for honest food that i can see being prepared.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
