"lately the rock bottom is hit or miss. the beers are always good and the uppity jagoff ipa is one of the best india pale ales i've ever tasted. the low point lately has been the food. i will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. that said i ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. the filling was okay but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
