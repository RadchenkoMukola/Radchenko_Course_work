"i was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. on a positive note i seen the google street view car downtown :)anyways my gyro just wasnt that good. it seemed smaller than any other gyro in town the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.also almost $9 for a small gyro frozen fries & a small drink is not a deal. m&ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large delicious gyro.  i dunno i've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll zorba's for downtown or m&ts afterhours.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
