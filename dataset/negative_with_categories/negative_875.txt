"sadly i've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. there's nothing really wrong with it. the portions are big and the food is alright and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.the food is sooooo bland though. everything you get at p.f. chang's you can get elsewhere in pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. the honey chicken at p.f. chang's was so mediocre all i could think about while eating it was heading over to wai wai in bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. i don't think i've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. he brought my girlfriend's father (don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. he then got all huffy when don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. when he came back to take our order don ordered for himself and his wife and before janey (my girlfriend) and i could order he had already started to walk away. we actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way either) after that he must have thought we were terrible diners (i don't think i've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work or anyone for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. but it's soooooo bland! go somewhere else for chinese! look up chinese on urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good local places to choose from at half the price.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
