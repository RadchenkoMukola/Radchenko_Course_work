"waaaay over priced and although their appetizers were good i'm not sure if it's bc we went in august and the kitchen was hot and the cooks were sweating their butts off back there but they salted their pastas waaaay too much. one of the pastas in their trio had sun dried tomatoes and capers in it. you'd think they'd tone down the saltiness of the pasta to let the saltiness of the sundries tomatoes and capers pull it together but no. i felt like i was eating strands of salt.  the ambiance is great and their wine menu is extensive. maybe it was a bad day but i think i can find better italian restaurants in pittsburgh with it's strong italian roots.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
