"avoid at all costs!  they diluted my wine with water the food was mushy they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from a can (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the ceo can fly in his private jet (after landing eat at a real italian restaurant) and purchase a new bentley each year.  visit deblasio's restaurant for twice the portions; it is much cheaper as well.worst experience at a restaurant... ever!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
