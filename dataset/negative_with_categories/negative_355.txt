"i used to order takeout here once every month or so. the food tastes average and the price is good. it's your typical low-end chinese place. the last (and final) time i ordered here i just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. while i was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. he also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. the inspector looked at me like i was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  as for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. the carpets are just filthy and the walls match. there are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there so be careful not to trip. the workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness don don is lacking.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
