"mccormick & schmick's knockoff is the best way to describe this completely non-memorable place. i agree with the other person who said it's trying to be a swanky hotel bar/restaurant. that may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels & their restaurants it can easily go either way. i've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. i hope for pittsburgh this is not the case. did i expect more from a westin? yes. am i surprised? no.sub-par sushi. tasted like takeout from wegmans (holler rochester!). my sauv blanc was room temp & obviously an old bottle because it tasted nothing like it should (kim crawford is my standby so this was extra disappointing). walk across the street & check out the tonic bar i wish i had.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
