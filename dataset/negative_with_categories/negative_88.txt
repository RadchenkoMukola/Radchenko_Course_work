"i tried to go here for the second time today.  i say tried because i sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging i was there.  i ended up going next door to the map room for lunch.the first time i had gone i had a server come and take my order a kitchen guy ran it out and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  i went to the counter for my check and thought that i wouldn't give it another go.  well you can't say i didn't try. i had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad but its not a place i'd make my go to pizza place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
