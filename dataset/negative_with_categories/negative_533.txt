"monte cellos is located fairly close to my work and so i've gone a few times.  each time i ask myself why am i going back?mediocre dish after mediocre dish somehow i think it will get better next time.last time i had a grilled chicken salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  it was grilled chicken french fries a little cheese on chopped lettuce. can you say b-o-r-i-n-g?today i had a steak hoagie.  enough places in pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  while the bread is fresh and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. the bread is 90% of the meal. unmemorable.i was happy with the pizza i had there but for salads and hoagies? not so much.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
