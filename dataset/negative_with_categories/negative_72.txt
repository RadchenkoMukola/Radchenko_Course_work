"i went here at 3 pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. i ordered the chili mac supreme to go. i thought i would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.long story short my food never came... the waitress told me (after i had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet so i told her to cancel it and walked out. now i see that others on yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. wish i had looked it up earlier.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
