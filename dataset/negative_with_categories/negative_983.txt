"the food is standard american fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  the k√∂lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  the service is good but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  i've been to the one at the denver airport as well but i was stranded and had free meal tickets so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from rock bottom it was.  since it's a recognizable national chain i think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craft-brew experience.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
