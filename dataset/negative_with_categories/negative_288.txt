"if i could give this place less than one star i would. i have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. the decor is tired and grimy the place reeked of smoke and the bartender/server was surly to put it mildly. we went there on a saturday night with a mind to try the irish food. apparently we were out of luck. i've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. he told us before we ordered that they had no pies. no chicken pot pie no shepherds pie etc. so we gamely tried to order other things. we placed our order. my wife for example ordered the irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. at that point my wife picked out a third option ham and cabbage only to be told again that they were out. at that point realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus we asked to pay for our drinks and left. they actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. in short unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression i'd probably avoid this place like the plague. speaking of the plague i suppose we should thank mr. surly for inspiring us to walk out. i only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
