"being a korean-bbq lover and snob..i needed to get my bulgogi/gal-bi fix when i was in pittsburgh.  my search led me to sushi-kim.oh how i wish it led me astray.  this was probably one of the worst tasting korean barbecue places i have ever been to.  the beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  the beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  i felt like i had to chew each piece 100x or i was going to choke and die.  i was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
