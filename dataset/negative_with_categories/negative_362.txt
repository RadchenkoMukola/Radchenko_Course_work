"coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  the tables the decorations the menu.  all the same.  does that make you a little worried?  yes.i ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  very very oily.  the actual ravioli was okay enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  did i mention that?  ambiance like i said left much to be desired.  i don't think i'd have this place on my list of musts for downtown.  much better restaurants to visit!",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
