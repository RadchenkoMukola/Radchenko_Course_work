"had a very lack-luster mother's day brunch at casbah yesterday. despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m. we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. i asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. service was fine. timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. an utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but i think casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
