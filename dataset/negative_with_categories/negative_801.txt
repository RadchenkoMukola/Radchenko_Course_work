"redo!i went to pf chang's several years ago and was not pleased with the food that was presented to me.  my issue: i thought i was getting chinese food.  my resolution: try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented american food with names of those chinese dishes i actually like to eat.so we returned to pf chang's for lunch to try this american food in this caricature of a chinese restaurant.  there were very few people in the restaurant.  the two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  when our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:coca colaiced teapan fried pork dumplingssesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soupchangs chicken with white riceour drinks and my soup came out immediately.  unfortunately i was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before i had a chance to say anything.  i could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times but at no point could i get her to come back to my table.  i tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  i didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  i asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. i didn't expect to get the stink-eye.my egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  the server really wasn't that into the experience but again gave me the stink-eye when i told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since i knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  i mixed the rice vinegar chili oil chili paste and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. i took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup but it was still brown.  i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  it was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  i saw no reason to continue.  i moved on to the dumplings which had an okay flavor to them.  the skins were a bit thick and doughy.  the meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  the sauce tasted a little odd so i tried to remix and it was still off.  i tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old stale or rancid.  we finished our dumplings.our lunch entrees arrived.  i had ordered mine extra-spicy but i guess it came pittsburgh hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  the meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  i tried some of chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  this was supposed to be their version of general tso's chicken.  now i have never had a general's chicken that was the same at any place.  it is always different.  many of them are good in different ways.  this food though it wasn't good.  chang's chicken fell into the same category as the sesame chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  i just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  even the yoshida sauce you get at sam's/costco tastes better.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
