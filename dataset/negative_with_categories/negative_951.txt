"stopped in for lunch. no greeter so we weren't sure where to go. super expensive for the portions. my salad had dressing only in the center. the rest was dry. my sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted bbq-ish  weird. but the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. it was disgusting. the waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. she however did not offer to comp the meal. i would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-(",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
