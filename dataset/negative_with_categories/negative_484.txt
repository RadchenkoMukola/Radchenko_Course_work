"i never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on me.my friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her. i don't know what she was thinking. not my scene whatsoever! we had come from a free devo concert. i was dressed in converses  a side pony tale and bright pink 80's garb. i have never seen so many idiots occupying one space. the chicks looked at me like i was an alien. not everyone needs to wear 5 inch heels gobs of makeup and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress. i like fashion i love heals. it was the glassy vapid duplicates that i saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously bolt out the door! super bad energy in this place. i jumped in the first cab i saw and headed to lawrenceville. i didn't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there. smoke bomb disappeared! she knew i would hate it but just didn't want to go alone. i was pissed.the night was not lost. my awesome fiends from la (stunt man curtze and elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer) met me out and we dive bar-ed the rest of the evening away. i meant to write friends but didn't change it because fiends haha... much more appropriate. i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort. some of my favorite people like bossa nova. just stating my personal experience.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
