"oh how the mighty have fallen. this place used to be good. something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.writing this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. the beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. i essentially live across the street so i know i'll go back but i hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
