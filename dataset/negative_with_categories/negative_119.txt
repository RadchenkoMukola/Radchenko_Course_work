"this place has gone significantly down hill.  i've gone to sing sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  when we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  it was always packed.  however each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  i was there last saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  very slow and boring.  it appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  this was likely my last time at sing sing.  save your $7 and skip this place.  a real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
