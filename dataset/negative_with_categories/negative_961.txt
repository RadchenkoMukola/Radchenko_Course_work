"christos was one of the worst experiences i've ever had while dining in pittsburgh. they call this a greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter which was horrible. the gyro meat wasn't off the spick the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. the only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. over all everything was bad and i would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
