"this place is a train wreck. quiet? no. storm? yes. loud slow bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that i have. 1. the vegan / hipster / metal thing has got to go. all i kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the motörhead tank top. i am a huge motörhead fan but when i go to an overpriced restaurant i don't want lemmy to be making my food. 2. the food is bland. shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan. 3. the service was pretty bad. our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. i am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating. 4. last but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. the guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake the music was some sort of bjork style electronica that i am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild. i have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and quiet storm does not even come close to the top 10. i think pittsburgh deserves better.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
