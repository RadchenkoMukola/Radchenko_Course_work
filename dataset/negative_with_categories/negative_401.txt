"a native all my life and  never been finally went last summer. i felt it was the thing to do. i did not like squeezing in that miniscule bar and eating on a table the size of a frisbee. look i love food and rarely complain but i feel i have to be honest. like one guy said they don't really need our kudos now as they are there and will remain there. just like primanti's and isaly'soh wait haha. the food was passable but could be better. the oysters were good and if ever i do go back i will get just them because the crab cakes sucked. sure i am spoiled by the east coast cakes i have had in jersey and baltimore. and that is the only thumbs up ballymore will ever get from me!ooh trendy hotspot you should take visitors to fill them with cold irons and fried sea fare then take them home and they can say they have been there.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
