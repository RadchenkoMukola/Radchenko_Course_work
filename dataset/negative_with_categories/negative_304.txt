"i was underwhelmed with our dining experience. we are just learning portuguese for an upcoming trip to brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.menu was somewhat limited although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. i ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. the stew had seafood: clams mussels shrimp scallops and some type of summer sausage but not much else. the broth was oily. my husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. i might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price i will dine on entrees elsewhere.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
