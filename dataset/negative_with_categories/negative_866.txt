"my friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. after we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and i had ordered meal that came with a desert! really dissapointing all around.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
