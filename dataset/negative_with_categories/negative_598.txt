"villa used to be really good and reasonably priced.  ever since their facade renovation addition of a ice cream machine and maybe even date a little farther back ... the overall offerings are overpriced by about $2.00 per item on average.the pizza is good but if you order during rush hour you're in hit-or-miss territory for quality and temperature.  hoagies are usually good regardless of how busy they are it's just a matter of how long it'll take between ordering the hoagie and finally getting to eat said hoagie.  i haven't tried their salads or other dishes ... but for the most part i have heard nothing but positive reviews about their food.i've never been a huge fan of thin flimsy crusted pizzas ... so while nice sometimes i continue looking for a nice thick slice of pizza that i can adopt as my go-to quick lunch in downtown pittsburgh.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
