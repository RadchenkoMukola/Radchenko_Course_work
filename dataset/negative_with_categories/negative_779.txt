"i really like the chili. burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. pretty hard to mess up a side salad. as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. the staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. all in all what you pay is what you get. cheap and crap service.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
