"the front serves as a good pittsburgh sports bar. it's a particularly great place to watch the penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. there are lots of hdtv's and there is a good selection of beer. the food however is bland and is terrible bbq even for the northeast. i would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
