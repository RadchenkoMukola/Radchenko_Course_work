"we stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply.  however they have several cooked selections. that said we only stopped into this location for a drink and then moved on.the restaurant includes outdoor seating and a long straight bar that extends from the front of the restaurant to the rear.  overall the interior isn't spectacular but has several nostalgic photos of famous people (both local and national) some of the photos autographed.their drink selection is simple with many local brews and mass produced american beers.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
