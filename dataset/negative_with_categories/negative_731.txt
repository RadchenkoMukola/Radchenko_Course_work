"i'm in from out of town and i'm so surprised and disappointed about the level of we received here during a quiet sunday lunch hour. our waitress gave us indignant responses to every request with visible eyerolls to things like sharing fajitas. when an order came out completely wrong she said sorry for the mixup but i don't control the kitchen and made no effort to correct the order. had she showed any effort or contrition the error really wouldn't have bothered me but she actually seemed to act like it was our fault. it really disappointed me to have my dad treated like this on our family meal together on my final day in town. please train your staff better and treat customers with any level of appreciation or helpfulness.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
