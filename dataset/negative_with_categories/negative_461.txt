"this bar is cramped overpriced and the service is unbelievably slow. happy hour runs 4-6 so you'll show up at 5 have no place to sit or stand and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours you'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5 even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times i've been there).seriously avoid this place. when one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour direct them anywhere else.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
