"tried this place based on reviews in local paper and friends. this place was awful. we asked questions of the server and ordered based on them. neither was good.y friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down. her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  mine was just disappointing. the only thing i found good was the plain rice. i also thought it was extremely over priced. will not return.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
