"so disappointed with this place! i've been wanting to try it for some time and finally did and boy...what a letdown. i had heard that it was one of downtown's happening happy hour places but on the tuesday night i went it was 99% empty. the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average. the drinks weren't anything special either.  no innovation here in the food drinks or decor.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
