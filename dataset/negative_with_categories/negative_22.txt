"pretty okay pizza.  standard so-so pittsburgh pizza.  however  the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  he was rude when i asked him to come up talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). after arguing with me for a few minutes he finally decided to park and come up. i really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when i order delivery. and i certainly don't want to have to leave my house to go out in the cold for what is supposed to be delivery.   is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  this seems to be a recent trend pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  it stopped me from ordering from another place and it will stop me from ordering from ephesus again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
