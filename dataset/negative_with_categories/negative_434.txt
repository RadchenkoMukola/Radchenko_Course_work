"my first trip here was on a sunday at 4pm. i was surprised to see i was the only customer. we were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu. i wanted a verity so i picked the 2 pancakes 2 eggs toast sausage or bacon.i ordered my eggs scrambled and sausage links. i also ordered home fries and a glass of white milk. i could smell my food cooking as i waited anxiously ( i was starving)my food was ready in about 8 minutes and looked tasty.all in all good bargain and equal food quality i'll give them 2 stars.like a pirmantis it would probably be better if i had been drinking.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
