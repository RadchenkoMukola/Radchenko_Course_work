"arrived at 7:15 on a saturday night there was a 20 minute wait although although empty tables were visible.  got seated at 7:30 put order in shortly thereafter.  we got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food.  we looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we're getting frustrated.  the waitress apologized the kitchen was slow so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9:15 still hungry.  the food i saw looked good but i would never recommend this place.  it doesn't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
