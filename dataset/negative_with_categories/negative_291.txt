"seriously terrible.  just all around terrible.we've been to the ofm twice now... the first visit was acceptable but the second was absolutely terrible.  we had late reservations for a quick bite after a lovely night at the o'reilly to celebrate my husband's birthday.  as sushi lovers we thought this would be a great way to end the celebration.  we sat at the sushi bar and couldn't get the attention of our waitress or the sushi chef.  after an exhausting 20+ min wait in our seats and just as i was about to go find someone we finally were able to place our order.  again... waiting waiting.  oh our wait was enhanced by guests of the hotel (tweens loaded with makeup from what appeared to be dance competition and their drunk parents) standing behind us. no they were not eating they were just standing there... yelling at 11pm.  our server returned to bring my husband's glass of warm white wine and commented on how terrible our experience must be but did nothing to help... no drink refills no offer to call the manager nothing.   hubby sent the 14$ glass of bath water i mean wine back to the bar only to have it replaced with you guessed it! another glass of warm white wine.  our sushi was finally ready and it was edible but not enjoyable...  no flavor in the fish and hard rice.  we left before finishing our 40$ meal (1 glass of wine 1 water 1 roll 2 orders of sashimi).  i almost asked for the manager but frankly was tired of waiting and just wanted to get out of there.  to top it off we paid $12 for valet parking that would not be validated unless we spent $50 at the restaurant.  we will not give it another chance and suggest you don't give it a first.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
