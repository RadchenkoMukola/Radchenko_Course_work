"terrible crab bisque. my husband liked the fish stew though.  it had lots of beans was thick and chili-like. the rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy i can't remember what i ordered though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  i do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
