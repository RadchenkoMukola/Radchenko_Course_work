"got into pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. i give them a half star for this. they have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. i give them another half star for this. i ordered what i thought would have the most vegetables the vegetable calzone. they ended up delivering a mediterranean calzone which was also vegetarian but it wasn't what i ordered. the small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh so i give them another half star for this. i didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.they told me it would be about a 45 minute wait but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. i give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. this place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese but it's not a vegan delight!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
