"i have only ever been to market square once before so i was excited to find myself here again! darren suggested the original oyster house for our afternoon meal. mmmm seafood! i could go for some good seafood especially fresh oysters! now i am from an area not far from the ocean and every year we had a community oyster roast you know: fried steamed and raw oysters. ummm yeah. big let down. i should know better than to have high expectations. if i wanted long john silvers or better still captain d's (look it up if you never heard of captain d's) then i'd hit up one up and get a friendlier server to boot. i also bet i could get into a ladies room without needing a key elsewhere or even some sweet n low for my tea! sorry...the more i write the angrier i am getting. one thing i am starting to notice about this area it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. i suppose i was jaded before.ok the food itself. the side of coleslaw was rather good. it tasted fresh and creamy! the crabcake...(can i call it that?) was more like a clump of stove top stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok. at least they weren't too greasy. and the frigg'n original oyster... where is the oyster??? nothing but breading. i think i saw something resembling an oyster in there somewhere. and every entree had to be fried. ugh.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
