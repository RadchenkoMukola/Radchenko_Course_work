"so i decided to surprise my fianc√© one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. the martinis were just ok and the food was very basic and nothing special. i will give the place another try and get some non appetizers next time and hope the bartender is a bit better at mixing the drinks.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
