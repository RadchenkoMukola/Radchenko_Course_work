"i've been going to this bar randomly over the last 5 years. it's definitely gone downhill.my last experience here was when i was trying to plan a birthday party during happy hour on a friday during the summer. when i called to reserve some space they told me they only reserve seating areas for people who pre-purchase food. which the pre-purchase options were about $10-12/person. i wasn't about to pre-order food for a casual birthday get together. so figuring they'd probly be very busy on a friday night we got there around 4:30. there were maybe 6 people around the bar. no one in the lounge seating area. i sort of felt undervalued as a customer for not being able to reserve space when no one was there. 5:30 came around the bar got a little busier but no where near the packed house crowd they painted as a picture for me when i tried making reservations.our waiter was sub par. people sat without drinks for 20+ minutes and some people just didn't get to order because one person would order a drink and the waiter dashed off leaving others to call out after him (to no avail.) he would basicalyl take 1-2 orders and run off not to return for 10 minutes. this place is average in food price and quality. but the attitude of this place could be better. go to six penn instead. they have outstanding service without the pompous attitude and in the summer they have a roof top patio with a bar and lots of seating. best in town!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
