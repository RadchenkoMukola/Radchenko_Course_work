"the food is acceptable. they have a pretty wide range but narrow the menu on pirates game days. i tried the seared ahi tuna. it was good but nothing memorable. the location appears to be the best thing about the place. sitting outside on a warm evening looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a pirates game is an interested dinner experience. but don't go for the menu.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
