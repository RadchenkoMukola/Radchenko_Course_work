"first do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. that pissed me right off. second the rolls here are sloppy. not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite) but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. after my experience with the toro i don't think i will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. while the rolls are large the prices were quite steep not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
