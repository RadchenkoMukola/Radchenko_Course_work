"to start the bathrooms are disgusting with that being said i would never eat anything here again.  this is a neighborhood bar for me.  i've been in here a handful of times the crowd is never rowdy or out of control.  the bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere. i normally only drink coor light drafts which are 2.75!!! that's a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars.  i have had the wings in the past before i saw what a disaster the bathrooms were.  they fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh. the patrons are a older work crowd not too may youngsters here.  i have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
