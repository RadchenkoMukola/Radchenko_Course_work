"this place has the worst customer relations i've experienced in pittsburgh since i moved here two months ago. my boyfriend was about to order a gyro i was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog i had gotten elsewhere there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. the person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that i was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. he canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. not only did knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day but they also lost both of us as future customers. what a petty and pathetic place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
