"sharia don't like it and neither does becky. boy and i went to casbah on a warm tuesday evening. the restaurant wasn't busy and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. we shared a bottle of mission la caminade (malbec french). this was a very good medium-bodied wine. many yelpers have raved about casbah's bread and pesto. i don't get it. i've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. i had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  the soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough but something was off and i barely ate half of it. i ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. the cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. i am sad to report that this too was tasteless. the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. we glanced at the dessert menu after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy boy and i decided to cross the street for ice cream instead. overall casbah has a nice atmosphere and service but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
