"i've been to cain's quite a few times since i live right down the street.the best times i have had at cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a jameson and ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. don't get me wrong if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment you would love cain's. definitely avoid going on the weekends.but i will admit that cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar drink a few beers and catch a pen's game on one of their million tv's. bottom line : this place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. cains is at best a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot. nothing more and nothing less.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
