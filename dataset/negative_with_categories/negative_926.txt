"food was not good at all! my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. i ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. the salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with way to much vinegar dressing. my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. my pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. my husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. we ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. we took it home & it was so bad i didn't even eat my leftovers. and i hate wasting food!! plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. don't waste your time eating here. there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
