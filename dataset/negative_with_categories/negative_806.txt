"while i love mad mex this one is to be avoided.  for whatever reason they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions i've just not felt well after eating there.  because it's a bb i just keep thinking i had to be wrong about that.  but after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues i've had to write this location off.  go to robinson instead... (or bb please please get a new km for this location!)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
