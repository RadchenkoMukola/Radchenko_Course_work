"my mistake that i went to namaste india with my cousin. pappad were served in the beginning and that was the only moment we could afford a smile! rest was a complete disaster..we ordered aloo tikki and much recommended samosa chaat!!  samosa chaat was cold to touch- looked like a heap of poorly cooked samosa.. worse was the red chilli powder used as garnishing ( we asked it to be a bit spicy- our fault) ..that too in plenty... we could have used that amount of red chiili powder for cooking food for some 6-7 people!! taste was below average...we could barely think of ordering main course after the initial encounter.. malai kofta is what we ordered besides daal... malai kofta looked like stuffed with samosa!! ( pun intended) ... bland and tasteless.. naan were good ..thin  baked properly...out only consolation... no wonder we left half of the  ordered dishes...worth mentioning is the fact that..kohli's store is adjacent and we saw some samosas there..i wonder if the ones we had at namaste were part of the same deal? please beware of this place- you may end up cursing yourself for your visit later on... as we are doing right now...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
