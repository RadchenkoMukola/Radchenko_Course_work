"i'm new to pittsburgh with a job on the north shore. i had a craving for some korean food and went to the place nearest my office - sushi kim in the strip district that boasts both korean food and sushi.let me say up front - the food i received was delicious. but i was a bit disappointed with the portion size for my lunch entree. for $12.95 i received just a few portions of ribs (i ordered the kalbi) just 3 ban-chan (side dishes of kimchi sprouts and broccoli) a small serving of white rice and a miso soup.delicious food small portions and a bit overpriced.  i was thinking of coming back to try to sushi but i think the price structure needs to be reworked before i return.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
