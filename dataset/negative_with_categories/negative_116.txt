"the italian coldcut sub was a travesty! lots of stale bread with skimpy meat portions and no hots or flavor. bread better suited for pigeons than people. i can find better italian sandwiches back home in baltimore. we'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  you get what you pay for. avoid this tourist trap!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
