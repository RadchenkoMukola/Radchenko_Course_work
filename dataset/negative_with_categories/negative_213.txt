"meh. i've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. keep in mind that i haven't had pizza from this place yet!their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about but a pretty good example of the standard pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.the seafood calzone is another story. something in it was so bitter i couldn't quite eat it; i'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. whatever it was it was gross. the shrimp weren't that good either suffering as they did from that certain i taste like iodine flavor.the advantage to r&b is that they're open reasonably late given the location but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. which would be ok if i didn't live a block away (normally i'd just walk and pick it up but just for you yelpers i subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
