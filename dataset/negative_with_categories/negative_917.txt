"rotten food and over charging customer.i was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant but was greatly disappointed. the restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (i ordered takeout) denied there are prices online. the maitre d was reluctant to show the printed menu which is 10% more expensive than online led me to think the over charge was deliberate. the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab. since i didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food it had to be thrown away.   a lunch over charged and wasted.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
