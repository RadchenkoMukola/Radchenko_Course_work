"yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague. it's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  i literally walk past this subway 5 times a week.  even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. when i say gross i mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. the don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. what a wreck. as some one who eats at subway 3 times a week i feel entitled to my opinion avoid this subway.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
