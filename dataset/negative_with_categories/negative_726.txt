"i don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  the place is dated and could use updating.the waitress was good.  i think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.the food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  we are pros at making our own at home but when it was served i told her that there are variations to it.  her first bite she made a sour face.  my son and i then tasted it...understood the face after that.  way too much lemon juice in it soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was but seemed like pesto.  the pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. my son and i had the fried seafood platter.  aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease the oysters were raw and the battered fish had no flavor.  the breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  needless to say none of us finished our food. underneath the food the plate had a puddle of grease. on the upside the coleslaw bread and crab cake was good.  the make and cheese was edible but seemed to comparable to stauffer's.this was our first and more than likely our last visit.  for a $65 dollar meal it wasn't worth $10. .",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
