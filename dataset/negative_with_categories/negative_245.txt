"i really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  first it's not about the service price decor or the food.  i'm writing this review after going there twice.  the first time my husband and i went the dinner was good.  we thought this place has the potential to be our go-to chinese restaurant in pgh.  today i remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  the won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  the entree was fine.  what really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   i had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  the smell wouldn't leave me so i came home to rinse my mouth with listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as i could) to get rid of the smell.  did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  [first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
