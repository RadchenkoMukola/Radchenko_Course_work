"this used to be the best german food in town. i have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. the gravies have changed and the max's goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. the sides are still great but the food used to be so much better.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
