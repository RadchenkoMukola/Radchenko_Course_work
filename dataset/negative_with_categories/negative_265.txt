"i think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. when we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from shadyside robinson and ross park. even though it closer to my dad's house when visiting...its time for us to part ways. the food and service is never as good at this location. i love love love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. i couldn't even finish them even though i cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year i get to have them. total bummer.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
