"i'm really torn by this review. for years and years this was my favorite restarant in the downtown area. we went there last saturday for dinner and had what i would deem an average meal at exorbitant prices. the salads while tasty were much smaller than i had remembered previously.  the side dishes again were seemingly smaller to not only me but our party as well. unfortunately the worst part of my meal were the steaks. for $45 i received a new york strip that was way overpriced (my wife makes it all the time and much much better) and was in a word chewy. the service overall was quite good unless you like a car valet (they don't have it). next time i'll try morton's or capital grille.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
