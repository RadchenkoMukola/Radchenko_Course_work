"i was here on 10/3 and i have to say this was a horrible experience.  me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  it took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  we ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  no refill on my beverage no how is your food no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  i will not be back again to eat.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
