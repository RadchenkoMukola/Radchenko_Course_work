"i am bummed about this- i had high hopes. here's a rundown of the evening:pros:- super friendly waitress stephanie who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout - yummy elderflower and pear beverage- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y- hot delicious breadcons:- oysters were sketch. and i don't feel good about that. stephanie brought us an order of east coast oysters to replace the west coast ones that we sent back.- fresh grated horseradish had no flavor or heat- what's up with that?- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies unevenly seared and no real flavor. and at a whopping $25 a plate i expect some nummers!i doubt we'll go back- for those prices i would prefer mccormick's or ruth's chris.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
