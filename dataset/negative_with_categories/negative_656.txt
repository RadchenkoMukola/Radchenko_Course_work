"okay i'm a heretic. i'm prepared to be stoned by the fundamentalists.a native sent me here an apparent pittsburgh landmark. my wife and i are not cole slaw fans so we ordered our hot sausage sandwich sans slaw.what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich. the fries were lifeless and the hot sausage was not not. the bread was devoid of texture and flavor.so yeah i didn't order it the way it's supposed to be. maybe if you're into cole slaw this is the place to go but if you don't keep walking. service was indifferent at best.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
