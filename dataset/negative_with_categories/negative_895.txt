"yesterday i had the misfortune of getting a pizza from bishops. it was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. needless to say. i won't be getting one again. i got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. the pizza was bland  tasteless. crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. the sauce was meh. cheese was okay. sausage was disgusting. bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. i don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. i don't recommend getting a pizza from bishops",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
