"ahh the only place near the train station that is open past 9 pm isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. i got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. the pizza was decent. there was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. i felt sick before i got halfway through it. that reminds me - the slices are huge and are $2. the onion rings were extremely basic - i gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.one irritating thing i overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like we don't have those anymore or no we can't cook wings dry. sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
