"its okay but it was just ok.  there's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  we were expecting that would be for the table.we started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  the mozzarella was unremarkable deep friend mozzarella in breading.  of course it was good it is fried cheese!  but it was nothing special.  the polenta was a real stand out tasted home made and was delicious.they give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  this was free so i'm not complaining but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  also the breadsticks were covered in rosemary and i loathe rosemary.my friend had the special pan seared shrip over pesto penne and she loved it.  i had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  it was good but i felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.overall i would come here again but maybe i'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
