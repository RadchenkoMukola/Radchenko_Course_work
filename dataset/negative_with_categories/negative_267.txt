"i have been a customer of the triangle bar & grill for over twenty five years.  they have the best subs ever. but on this trip i was buying several to share with people from out of town.  they are cash only and more than happy to show you an atm that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  the employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  that $2.50 came out of their tip they can hit up their boss for the rest.  its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.  shame on them.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
