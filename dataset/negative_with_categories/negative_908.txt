"i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. i won't go back. the first time we were there almost 3 hours. it took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. when i complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. it made no sense how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? after arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. ridiculous. if it were up to me i would have never returned. unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. again it took a long time to get our food. my food was cold and bland my kids food was cold. my husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. the wedding soup and bread were good but that's it! my drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when i asked. bad food slow service and rude managers. i'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. not worth it at all with all the other good italian options around.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
