"i found buffalo blues to be merely ok.  i thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions and their wings were rather small.  i actually liked the wing sauces i tried though (red hot and spicy garlic).  our server was friendly but not terribly attentive.  i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  for $10 i would certainly get my money's worth and the quality of the food was ok.surprisingly lots of vegetarian options.  a vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
