"the food isn't terrible but not impressive.  i lived in la for 4 years so i'm super spoiled when it comes to having good meixcan food.  we got a burrito which was just stuffed with fillers such as rice and beans..no thanks.  there was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever.  who seriously wants a huge burrito like that?  i'd rather have a normal sized one that actually tastes good and isn't filled with crap.  we got the steak fajitas which were actually pretty decent.  the steak was cooked perfectly as ordered which i appreciate.  we also got the chips with salsa and guac which were good but come on it's really not hard to mess those up!  overall i'm just not impressed but i guess you can't really find that great of mexican food options in pittsburgh.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
