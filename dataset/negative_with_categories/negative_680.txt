"i worked at millers back in the nineties. the fish was fresh every day from wholeys the bread was fresh everyday from mancini's and the perogies were made by little old babushka women at st. george's down the street. it was a great place to eat. people cared about the food and it showed. i can only attribute it's decline to a change in ownership. i stopped in to satisfy a craving for fish and was very disappointed by the grease pile i got instead. i used to be proud to cook there. now i wouldn't put it on a resume for fear that people have experienced it lately.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
