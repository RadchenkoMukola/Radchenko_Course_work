"i went with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers to this joint for lunch last week. as the rating suggests - meh.it wasn't terrible and the service was fine. i just feel like i've had much better pizza elsewhere around town. and for sure a better margherita. theirs fell into the category that i find most end up in: a regular cheese pizza. quite a few places seem to not understand the differences between the two and this place was no different.now the cheese/margherita pizza they served me was pretty good but it didn't stand out for me. the other two ordered sandwiches of some sort that they both really seemed to like. the beer selection was also a bit lacking for my taste but that may just be because they didn't have anything i liked so i stuck with water (that's me when i go out to eat: alcohol or water ;).",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
