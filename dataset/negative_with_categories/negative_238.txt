"they took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  they'll make one for you especially but i always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.plus this one is always really quiet.  like i feel guilty like i'm troubling the staff.  and you have to drive through an apartment's parking lot to get there.  very awkward location and atmosphere.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
