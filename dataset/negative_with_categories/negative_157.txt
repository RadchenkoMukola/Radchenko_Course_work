"came here on a sunday it was slow and we got our food in good time.ordered two personal size pizzas spicy fries fried zucchini & onion rings. the pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. tastes plain & over cooked. ok so the reason why i'm giving this place 1 star is because i saw soooo many health code violations! * a redbull can on the pizza dressing table.* the woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! she just went right back to working on making the pizza! * the same woman who charged me -not kidding ...her nails were long & yellow mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. yuck!! * same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought and blew the smoke inside the restaurant. price range in yelp language is $$i definitely won't go back because if that's what i was able to witness in the front of the place i don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! i don't think i'm being harsh. that was one too many violations in my opinion.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
