"i'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. every time i have ever gone the service is awful. it's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. i think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. also the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee and that's it.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
