"maybe i am just the most jaded vegan in town; quiet storm's food menu bores me to tears that which i will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! their coffee isn't all that great either as given the choice local la prima is in my favor. tears. this is the only vegetarian restaurant on the east side of town and oh so close to me but i cannot stand to go there. desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
