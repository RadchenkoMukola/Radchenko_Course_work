"given that the rusty nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources i'm sad to say i was sorely disappointed. they have a wide selection of breakfast options.  however even with numerous breakfast specials listed not one included eggs meat potatoes and toast.  yes that's right.  i had to order the eggs bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  when my food was served the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  i did greatly enjoy the potatoes though which i ordered deep fried.  my dining companion ordered the french toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  we were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  the service was good.  and it's not that i thought anything was bad it's just that as the two star rating says meh i've experienced better.  given the plethora of choices in bellevue this will not be my first stop should i find myself on lincoln avenue for breakfast again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
