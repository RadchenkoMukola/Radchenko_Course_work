"didn't eat here...this review not about the food.  we went on friday night around 8pm there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  the hostess asked us if we had a reservation we didn't  and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  wtf?  we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame the fish was good there. crappy hostess for sure.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
