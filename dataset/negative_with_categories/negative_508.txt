"i don't care what cub and bulls fans think this steeler and penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. first the crust tastes like a biscuit and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. i will give unos a thumbs up on it's flatbread it's better pizza than some pizzerias in the area. when i look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me this place is a dud. guess what? chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
