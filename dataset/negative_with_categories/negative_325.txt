"this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at. the food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char which none of our food had. i question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces he acted confused when i asked for them. additionally we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. this restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other i've eaten at.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
