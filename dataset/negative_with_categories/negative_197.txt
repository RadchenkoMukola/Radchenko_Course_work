"we had the worst possible experience at the eat n park at waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. our waitress (annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. we ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. one of my friends ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which according to the menu description should've had lettuce and tomato in it. but the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. when pointed out to the waitress she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! how crude! spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. when i asked the manager about the buffalo chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that buffalo chicken sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! what a lame excuse! even your online menu says under the description for a buffalo chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked kaiser roll. - that's what the last line in the description of buffalo chicken sandwich says. shame on you manager for lying! instead of admitting her fault she was blaming it to a new menu!not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. i am never going to come back to any eat n park location ever again and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. what a waste of time and money! plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness i surely had my patience tested this evening!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
