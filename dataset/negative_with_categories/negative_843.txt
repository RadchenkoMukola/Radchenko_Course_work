"ate this yesterday and was very impressed with the atmosphere and scenery but that was about it. the wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor. i figured seafood would be their bread and butter but their ahi tuna was tasteless. the salads you get with an entree is the size of a dixie cup and the lettuce is cheap iceburgh crap. if i go back again i will def just order beer and appetizers as the buffalo shrimp were pretty good. if showing someone the city this is a good place for atmosphere but if you're a food critic check your taste buds at the door.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
