"the food is usually pretty good however the service is almost always very very slow. most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. although they still technically do their job you can feel very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. it's a hit and miss. unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. the low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
