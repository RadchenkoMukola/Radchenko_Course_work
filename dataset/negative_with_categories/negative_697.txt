"how this place got 4 stars when there are so many better options in pittsburgh is beyond me.  the only thing that was noteworthy about the experience here was the price. the food was bland. nothing to write home about. the place looks uppity but really the food is just ok. go to ruth's chris instead.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
