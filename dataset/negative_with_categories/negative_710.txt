"my coworkers and i had lunch here on a friday afternoon and it was a pretty meh experience for me.  we were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar in a room that i didn't even know existed so apparently buffalo blues is bigger than i thought.  it's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.i went for the hot veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  the sweet potato fries weren't too bad with a good flaky crisp.  the sandwich left something to be desired.  it wasn't hot first of all - i'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese but all the veggie ingredients were cold leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  the hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  there wasn't a lot of exciting flavor  it was just belly-filler really.  i guess that's what i get for trying to order healthy here.  i just wasn't much interested in it and i don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  i better have a darn good sandwich if i'm paying $8.  also it was relatively small in size - i don't have a huge appetite so that wasn't a problem.  but i guess i think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious or big enough that i can take half home.  buffalo blues was neither.not particularly interested in returning for any reason.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
