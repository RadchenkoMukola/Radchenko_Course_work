"just awful. my companions each ordered an alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.we thought maybe it's a 'burgh thing.nope we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed alfredo sauce and that the chef just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his alfredo. this stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.anybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. by the way my lobster roll was a buttery greasy fail as well.what a complete disaster.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
