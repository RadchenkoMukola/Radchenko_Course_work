"had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... after seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows i was very excited to eat hear . wow  what a dissapointment  this place is so over hyped it isnt funny . to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke . the sandwiches may be big  but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . to steal a line from a old tv commercial .... were's the beef .....  a major major dissapointment .",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
