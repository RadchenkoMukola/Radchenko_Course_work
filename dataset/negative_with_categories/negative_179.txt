"first off:  i'm a picky eater so take this with a grain of salt.okay i'm not from pittsburgh.  i am not overweight not a hipster not on any of the plethora of drugs i own my own home  probably most of all i've never heard anything about this place before walking in so i had no idea what to expect besides lets get breakfast.if you are the opposite of any of these points this place is probably worth a try for you.we had a horrendous wait but i think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...i don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.the waitresses are ornery but not rude...just clear.  they aren't going to make nice or kiss your rear they're not there for that.  i found this respectable and liked it.but the food?  oh god.pros:  portions are massive all the other reviews will tell you that.            1) prices are reasonable cheap even but i suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  seriously...i think i had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.            2) ....uhm.  ....  nothing was dry?cons:  there was no color anywhere.  absolutely everything on every plate i saw in the place was some blend of beige.  potatoes egg white pancake sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish everything was the same color.               half my dish was potato.               the egg was not over-medium it was still-runny even the whites.  i presume this was because they were slammed and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.             the sausage was not identifiably sausage.             i had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.             there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  nothing raw nothing green nothing fresh not even as an ingredient. even mcdonalds has a fruit cup ffs!  taco bell has better quality food!             take one look at the clientele when you walk in.  it attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasy-spoon truck-stop.  if you are not one of those people do not bother this place makes denny's look classy.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
