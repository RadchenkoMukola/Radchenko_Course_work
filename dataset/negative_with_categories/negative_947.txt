"ordered delivery. the food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable as it's (just) within the delivery window specified. however the food had apparently been prepared within 15 minutes of receiving our order because it was cold by the time we got it. i didn't listen to the other reviews and paid the price (literally)... if someone else is saved a crappy sw dinner by this review my meal (or lack thereof) will not have been in vain.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
