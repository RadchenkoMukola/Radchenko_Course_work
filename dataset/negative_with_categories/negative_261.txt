"one in our party summed it all up:  when you're paying these prices you should expect better service.the food was good.  i had a sashimi platter with some additional pieces which was perfectly average.  you can get the same thing around the corner at sushi kim...and i think the quality is a bit better and the price lower.another in our party had the rib eye.  it was cooked well and he liked it.  for dessert the cheesecake was good although the blueberries were clearly from frozen (unacceptable in july when they're in season).i had to sit and wait 5 minutes after my food was brought out before i could flag down a server to ask for some chopsticks and soy sauce.it's not that the servers aren't working...it's that they're spread too thin.  understaffed.  all working hard but covering too many tables.long story short i won't go back.  walk over one block and go to eleven!  same price better food and service.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
