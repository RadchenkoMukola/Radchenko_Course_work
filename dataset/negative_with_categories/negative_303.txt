"the only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the benedum. the three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. i could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. the food was a sorry sloppy soggy mess that would have had chef ramsey throw up. the service was slow inattentive and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. ridiculously overpriced. for  better value a nicer atmosphere and quality food i strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat tambellini's hands down - mcdonalds or subway.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
