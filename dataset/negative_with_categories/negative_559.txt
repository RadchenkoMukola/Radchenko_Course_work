"in my opinion sing sing is really not worth it. it gets expensive because you drink maybe start to sing a few lyrics drink some more think of a song you wanna hear put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper you drink they play it everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. i wasn't really into it when i first got there but as the night went on and lager went in i started to warm up to the place. i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time it's not worth it. but again that's just me.the 2 stars are for the piano players who are entertaining and very talented and the rock bottom brews they serve.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
