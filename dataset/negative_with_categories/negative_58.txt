"will i come here again?  yes absolutely for drinks they knocked the ketel one extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  the ambiance is very nice.  of the 4 types of reviews i give (awesome ok bad where they get slammed and bad where i hope they improve) here i am giving the heartfelt bad where i hope they improve.  our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  i mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  we went with appetizers she recommended.  not good.  seared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub the prep the tuna wasn't cool inside the chips were not good there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  not good.  with heartfelt advice compare this against outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  the chef should do so.  (he's a nice guy like me i hope.)  bbq shrimp: go try redstone's (philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  it is chilled very delicious.  this appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  the barbecue sauce was horrible overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  gordon food service or sysco bbq sauce.  a real must-miss.  cod entree was ok.  the skillet beans were too firm too mature they need petite green beans.  potato skin had grit in the mashed.  why 1 star?  the price was close to capital grille but far from the cuisine.  i hope they spruce it up.  the place is nice.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
