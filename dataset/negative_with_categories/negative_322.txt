"i ordered a fave of diners the pittsburger. cheesesteak.  it's a burger with cheese coleslaw french fries  all piled between 2 thick pieces of bread. looked ok.  it however didn't work for me. the coleslaw was great though!!it's not much of a cheesesteak. it's a weird burger. that burger seemed like a fried frozen burger. not much cheese either. my crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. they looked great. i don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. i can't hold it against them though. i chose poorly. i think they are probably good though. my motto: eat food you recognize.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
