"there are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. this was highly recommended to us while visiting pittsburgh. first we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a sunday. we wanted bar type food with a couple of drinks. we were told to go there by several people. i got the capacola great concept putting the coleslaw and fries in the sandwich but it just tasted bland to me. i asked for them to toast the bread but they said they couldn't do it because it sticks to the grill... can't put a piece of bread on the grill? again when there a memories of this place i am sure the sandwich taste better than they really are. but as an outsider judging the food alone it was sub par.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
