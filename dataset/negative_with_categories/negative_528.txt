"we went to the mad mex in cranberry twp and won't make the mistake of going back. the food was horribly hot like they just toss in heat for heat's sake rather than for taste. i ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was not any kind of mole i've ever had. the sauce was more like a weak thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. even the guacamole was too hot. i recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy fusion of tex-mex and ca but they failed. luckily they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so i was able to walk straight over for some tums.if you want good tex-mex go to el campo in monaca or el paso mexican grill in chippewa. both restaurants are excellent examples of good tex-mex similar to the styles typically served in central california.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
