"every time i come here hoping just hoping that i'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. raw. unfiltered. old school. like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.but each time i come away disappointed even more than last time.my father worked here three or four decades ago. i'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.the service is anywhere from good to great and they are fast and friendly!and maybe just maybe i come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. at odd hours. or an hour after the rush.every time the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  not a snappy casing no this is like barely edible hard exterior.so what's a man to do? try again?  sadly i'll probably forget about my recent experiences and try them again.i just hope they are fresher next time because i can't imagine them worse than today.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
