"i think i'm spoiled when it comes to chinese buffet because i live in an area with fantastic buffets. liang's buffet is not great. it fills your stomach but that's about it. their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so chinese food. on the plus side service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open. that's worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at night.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
