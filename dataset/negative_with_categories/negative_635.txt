"poor excuse for seafood!   the place is overrated.  good place to have drinks on a saturday or sunday afternoon-but that's about it.  the employees are anything but friendly. unless you sit at the bar the service is poor. isn't even that great at the bar.  if you want good seafood go a couple blocks up the street to luke wholeys.  so much better quality!  this place is definitely not for those with sophisticated palates!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
