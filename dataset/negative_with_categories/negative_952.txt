"i went for dinner july 10.  tight quarters inside but nice outside covered porch..small inviting bar. parking lot is full of potholes. it wont take much to fill with small stones but nothing has been done for years. it would be nice for customers to the fill potholes. friendly staff . i ordered a italian hoagie and my wife had spinach ravoli. waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks. my hoagie was dry with min meat. bun was ok. my wife liked her salad. both was very avg food in tight spaces and service could have been more attentive. probably wont go back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
