"this location is terrible. the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. i waited 5 minutes before being able to order even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. then the lady proceeded to ask me if i would like anything on my burger and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) i asked doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture? she then told me it only comes with cheese. so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger. pulled around and got my order pretty quick but later when i open my burger its just meat and cheese. the meat is badly burned and cold. it was clear to me this burger was not fresh. i didn't even attempt to eat it what a waste of a place. they definitely need better workers.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
