"i came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. unfortunately i cannot because the service was so bad that i left before i had the chance to order. we found seats at the bar behind the taps. after sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged we thought that they might not be able to see us and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. it was fairly busy but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and i'm sure they face much busier times. we sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (i timed it - i am not exaggerating) and were not even acknowledged. you would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could but despite staring him down almost the whole time we could not even make eye contact. i hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
