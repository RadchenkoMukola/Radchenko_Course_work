"i told everyone that i wasn't feeling this. should have listened to my gut on this one. we didn't make reservations for our party of 7 which i suppose we should have. they had to create space for us. like really create it. where we were all sitting in the walkway. knew i was in the walkway when the waiter asked for us to move so that a little girl in a wheelchair could get around. but i didn't have a problem with that. what i have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building. and while you're eating too...it's so disgusting. the place is so freakin crowded as well...maybe just because i hate being in crowded and tight spots. as far as the menu i wasn't impressed. it took me 20 mins to find something (partly because i'm picky). but i ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo nothing to rave about. i wanted more broccoli than what was provided but oh well. the lime/kiwi lemonade was pretty good though.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
