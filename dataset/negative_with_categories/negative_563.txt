"why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me.  i had read prior yelp reviews and i knew what i was getting myself into.  to make a long story short i went here because i was with several other people that wanted to go here and i really had no choice.  anyway i ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken. the sauce was really disgusting. i found myself eating only the pieces of chicken breast.  i brought this meal home because my husband isn't as picky as i am but he took two bites and got mad at me for not warning him how aweful this meal was.  i will not be eating with this group of people again if they choose to go here again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
