"went there saturday november29 2014. entered establishment at 5:30 pm. pros.....very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it i've ever been served. sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....both very good although the fish was slightly overcooked. again...huge portions.   cons...after being at table since 5:30 nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. after being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked 15 minutes later it was served. as good as it was it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. they may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a saturday night. the best though was the incompetent hostess. the hostess with the leastest. talk about someone who didn't have a clue. from screwing up where we were supposed to sit to watching her continue to do the same thing with others at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. what a twit.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
