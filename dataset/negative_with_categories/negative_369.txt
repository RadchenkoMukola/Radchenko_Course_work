"visiting from san francisco. food was mediocre at best. bland is the best description.  sausages and  weiner schmitzel were unremarkable. best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. but also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas asparagus and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. good beer. yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
