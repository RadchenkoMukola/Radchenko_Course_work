"it wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  while it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  the food did come out hot at least mine did the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  everyone in the table resented me for holding back the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.which hey works as a segway onto the burger.  quesadilla burger.  i knew that was a mistake but i did it anyways.  the patty was sorta flavorful.  the toppings were in the bland category.  cheese went mia.  and the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.a big blah overall which is sad since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
