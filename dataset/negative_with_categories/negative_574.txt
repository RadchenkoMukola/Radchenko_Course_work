"not much of a review for this one but just a few tidbits of info...pool (on friday/saturday) is $14 per hour(i'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.the food is crap.the games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size not the shitty bar-room tiny pool tables).that is all.  :)(the pricing is based on my recent trip.we shot pool for a few hours i had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
