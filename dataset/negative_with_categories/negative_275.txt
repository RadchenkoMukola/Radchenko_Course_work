"although i've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro i wish i would have gone elsewhere. since i can only comment on their gyro; here goes... first the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something) second; they don't include enough dressing third; there are way way too many onions forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita - to be quite honest it just tastes bad.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
