"it was raining and we were in the strip district craving some seafood.  we decided to stop by roland's seafood grill.we were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the us open was playing.  our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  we were glad for the us open entertainment.my dad order the clam chowder soup which was chunky and bare of any clams.  my mom and i shared a couple of appetizers the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.service gets 2 stars and food gets 3 stars.overall this place gets a 2.5 stars.  if you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area stop by.  i would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
