"my boyfriend and i are in our 20s and have visited this d&b multiple times. after our visit yesterday however i don't think we'll be back. when we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. at first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this then one left while the line was still out the door! the girl that was left was more than incompetent and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. we stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. needless to say the line in the game room was just as long and they still only had one girl in the booth. it was a saturday! after we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. it took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. the floors were filthy with trash and the bathrooms: repulsive! i had to use the restrooms twice during our visit and not only did both bathrooms i used have no toilet paper in them but there was tp all over the floors and the sinks were less than cleanly. my boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. all i have to say is get your crap together. we could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on saturday compared to what it used to be and i'm i have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. it's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will not be returning anytime soon!",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
