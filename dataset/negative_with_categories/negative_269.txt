"ugh... i got a plate with seisage tofu scramble and sundried tomato toast. my whole plate was entirely dry chewy and unpalatable. i had high hopes for the tofu scramble especially after seeing positive reviews about it. but honestly... it tasted like nothing. i thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu but it was hard dry and chewy. hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... but that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. anything will taste better drenched in gravy. we think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. on top of all this service wasn't the greatest. i had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)i wanted when i ordered the toast option for my meal. then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. we had to tell someone else to get it for us. also they don't really wash their cups. there are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty. good idea but poorly executed food. i've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens avocados and more. for a vegetarian place there was nothing green on our plates. this experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
