"nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   after waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   it is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
