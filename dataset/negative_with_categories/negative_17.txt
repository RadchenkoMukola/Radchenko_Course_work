"i was pretty disappointed by this experience. and i usually avoid hotel restaurants for this very reason but i was tired and i was staying at the westin so here i am at the original fish market...i sat at the bar and ordered dinner. the bartender was very friendly and made sure she was taking care of me. so props to her! i got a menu and a sushi menu. ok i'm pretty sure pittsburg isn't the most awesome place for sushi but let's give it a shot! i started with the gumbo which came out warm and kind of bland. it wasn't good at all. and then i had a roll which was decent. and a spicy scallop roll. now everyone has their own take on spicy scallop but this was by far the furthest from what i could imagine a spicy scallop roll could be. it was a small roll cut into 6 pieces (maki). it had a very small amount of raw scallops which didn't taste super fresh. then the roll was topped with the spicy. i can't identify exactly the spices that were on top but i've had this type of spice combination on other japanese dishes. so i know it's an off the shelf thing. basically this was the worst roll i could imagine.so all-in-all the food was sub-par at best. and the entire menu was overpriced. i would definitely eat somewhere else if i had any energy at all. i'm sure the room service would have been better.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
