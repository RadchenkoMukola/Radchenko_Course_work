"the food at this place is at best mediocre but it deserves something better than 1 star given the good service. every other place in the neighborhood was either packed or seemed like it would have slow service so we decided to come in here despite it looking like it was closed with no one inside. we were served very quickly as promised and it's not the worst chinese food i've ever had. i know that's not saying a lot but given the limited options in the area it may be worth knowing about this place as a possible alternative.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
