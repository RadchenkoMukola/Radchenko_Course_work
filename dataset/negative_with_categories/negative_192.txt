"i should have known better than to stop here but i was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  i should kick myself for thinking of this place.granted i decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  the sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  during that time i wished i could have taken back my order and also wished that i hadn't paid already.  while sitting at the window i decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  what disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  what disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  i mean smelt them to see if they were clean instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  after witnessing this my food was finally ready and i drove away.when i finally got to eating my food i was underwhelmed.  the fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  the steakburger really they should just call it a burger was overpowered by the bbq sauce on it.  it was all i could taste.all this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
