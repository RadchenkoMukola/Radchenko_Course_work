"i stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and i had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  the server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  it would've been different if she had been slammed but the entire time she was standing by the bar just talking to her coworkers.  by the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  when we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  the one positive of the place was that i liked the ambiance but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  what i was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
