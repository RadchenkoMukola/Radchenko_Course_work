"for a place that has a $75 entree i was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   that was definitely a first.  i was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  but everything else about this place is shwag.  the seared tuna - garbage rainbow roll and caesar salad - weak  and the sides incredibly small.  the place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  if this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the westin.i would skip it or if you have to get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
