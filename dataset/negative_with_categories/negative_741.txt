"previous reviews have said it well: lackluster tasteless food.ate at primanti bros with a group of friends while in pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'man vs. food' and were assured that it is a pittsburgh institution. the sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9) but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. good in theory bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.we also had terrible service at the market square location; i'll chalk this up to a fluke. the patio seating at the market square location is wonderful on a sunny day but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.the legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
