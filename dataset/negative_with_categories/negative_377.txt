"when my boyfriend and i were down with the flu we ordered some food here through eat24. i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. when i unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup i found that it was cold and had bubbles in it as if there was soap in it. i couldn't really taste anything but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. to say the least i was disappointed in my soup. when my boyfriend cut into his calzone he said the cheese was barely melted. we thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. it was cold as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. he tried to take a bite but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.this was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have since our food was inedible. i heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise i've heard about this place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
