"my friend and i were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before mannheim steamroller and she suggested tambellini's. i hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so i agreed. it all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. you could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. she had zero personality. then we look at the menu. how much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? you're probably thinking $10 or $12 right? wrong! $20!! i was not happy about the ridiculous pricing but my friend and i felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. now i really wish we would have. i figured if i am going to spend $20 on simple pasta i'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. i'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so i could not have the bow ties with alfredo. all i asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. you would think i asked them to get giada delaurentis to come and cook my pasta. the waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. after all that i get my meal the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. i would have been furious if i paid $20 for tasteless pasta. never again will i go there. that place is the worst and i recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. the staff needs an attitude adjustment the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  the only reason i gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. otherwise it would have been a .5 or 1.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
