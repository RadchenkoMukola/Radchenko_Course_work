"in town on business and i always try to find places like this.  wow a martini bar not named the blue martini?  ok i'm in!so i strolled over and walked in.  first impression was it was a cool cozy and trendy joint.  liked the exposed brick walls lighting etc.  only problem is i don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!so i grab a table in the bar.  it was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  two bartenders made eye contact with me so i figured they would be waiting on me.  i figured wrong.  i sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a deer in the headlights look do you want a drink or something????  well hell what was your first guess?  i refrained from quoting foxworthy and saying here's your sign!so ok we were off to a bumpy start.  i didn't have a martini however there was a few options on the drink menu.  i was just here for a bite so my review is based on that.a few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  i say some turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  it seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  given the fact that it wasn't busy it did take a long time to arrive.  when it did it looked ok.  the fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash so i bypassed that.  the wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  the only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  it was very disappointing.all in all i think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  i will return to try a martini but i will pass on the food.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
