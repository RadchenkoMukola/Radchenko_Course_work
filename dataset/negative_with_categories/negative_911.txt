"i love crab cakes. whenever they are on the menu i have to order it. i got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. the crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. when i eat a crab cake i want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. sadly this one didn't do that for me.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
