"pass on this place there are better restaurants mere feet away.the menu here is too large which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  and its not good.  some of the salads are alright but its just not good food.the service is friendly and prompt but the beer is over priced.  they do have a good selection though.this place is open late if you need a bite to eat but there are so much better options out there.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
