"i am sorry to have to give the original fish market a 2 rating i could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. we waited too long for the waiter to initially great us and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant so this is the main reason for a 2 hopefully it's a rarity because the food was pretty good. i had the cod sandwich  it was hot and tasty probably one of the better fish sandwiches i've had. so it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
