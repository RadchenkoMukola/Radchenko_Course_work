"i'm staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and i thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner. well it was overpriced and the food was terrible. i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. the pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy the chicken was overdone (dry) and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. very bad food and overpriced. not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. she then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word though i met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. she was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff. http://www.atrias.com/",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
