"this place is just a flat out joke.  totally overpriced.  went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% service fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  first i asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  had no clue what i was talking about.  finally gave up and got a coors lite.  food was overpriced and less than average.  i had the baked scrod.  exact same dish at eat n park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  i would stay clear of this at all costs.  if you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at sonoma grill down the street.  i'm shocked this place is still in business.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
