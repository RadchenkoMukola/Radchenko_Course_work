"i can't even review this place. we sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. and i have to be clear it was a saturday afternoon maybe like 10 tables with people at them and i saw 3 waitress walking around. i think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant especially since burgatory just opened across the street.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
