"there are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. the staff doesn't seem to care. make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes luke warm. even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. you stand at the door 5min walk to the counter and ask again then walk back and wait at the door forever again until finally you head back to the counter one last time and freak out.. all to pop a squat over the toilet. this has happened on two totally different occasions. the workers themselves are ok and the managers are nice.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
