"poor service. monday evening. restaurant not busy. took 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. ordered a draft and a glass of wine and proceeded to order a lobster roll and steamed mussels. took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. the lobster roll then showed up and we had finished and the plate was then cleared for the table. we had then been in the restaurant for an hour and we asked for the bill. the waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready. we canceled the order and the bill came with a quick huff and sign the top copy please request as she quickly turned away. not worth wasting your time.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
