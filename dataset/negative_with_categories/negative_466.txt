"this place is just average. the service is subpar at best and the waitresses always seem rushed. however their wings and wing flavors are good and they have so many tv's there isn't a bad seat in the house if you're there for a game. now that the parking lot across the street is gone good luck looking for a spot. i would go back but only for the wings and the spicy cheese bites.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
