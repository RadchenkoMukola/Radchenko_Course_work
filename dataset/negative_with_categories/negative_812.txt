"i'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this tgi fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the chain expectation. i order the jack daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. the fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. the shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. even the water tasted weird.fortunately we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. i'd recommend the tgi fridays out in south hills village over this one any day.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
