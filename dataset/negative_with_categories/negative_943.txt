"prepare to be wowed. high class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. i thought i would try some of the world famous cuisine so i pulled up on a thursday evening. gar√ßon i asked may i try some of your french fried potatoes? i was greeted with a crackled mutter as i inched my vehicle forward. i was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. perhaps it was the clientele a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. perhaps it was the professional waitstaff whom i could hear laughing and socializing through my window. whatever it was the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. after some deep meditation i realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so i pulled away. i cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. i highly recommend this palace of excellence.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
