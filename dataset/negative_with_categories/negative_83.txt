"i really don't know how this place got any good reviews. one big problem is that the place is dirty the carpets the lighting above the tables and the furniture. i have tried this place 5 times in the past 2 years and this is how it went. the 1st time i had a burger which tasted funny and i didn't finish it. i got food poisoning and was so sick. this i thought might have been a stomach flu so i did try this place again. the 2nd time i was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.now i'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. i was going to stay away from the place but a friend from troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. no problemnext time i got french fries with gravy. how could this be a problem?.when they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.when i told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. needless to say i refused to pay for them. the 4th time my friend dragged me there i had a salad. i didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. the last time i only got a slice of pie and this was good. i no longer have to go to billy's my dear friend has passed away and i refuse to go anywhere near the place. to the owner-please sell the restaurant you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
