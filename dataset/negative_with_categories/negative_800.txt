"this place is something straight out of a david lynch film. it felt like i was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange and almost discomforting and nightmare-like. you are going to feel uneasy is what i'm trying to say. - they overcharged us probably intentionally. they don't have itemized receipts. - the waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. we caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.- the elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. better than nothing i suppose.- the food.... oh my god. none of our food was good. in fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. the hummus was decent but... i can also get decent hummus at trader joe's. we initially felt bad for these guys. a struggling business is always sad to see. but with all of the strange behavior attempts to scam us etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well. if the owners are reading this-- i'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really please rethink the way you are going about your business. i don't want you to fail i want you to overcome this. do it the right way not the scummy way. i know you're trying but try differently.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
