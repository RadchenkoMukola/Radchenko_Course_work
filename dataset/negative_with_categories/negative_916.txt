"so....i read the reviews on yelp & urban spoon.mostly negative but hey i was hungry and gave it a shot.it's true the place is dingy & like entering a greek grandfather's home. i was first asked  if i wanted huumus. i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. so i tried the $5.25 saganaki. it came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra.it tasted worse than it looked (if that was possible). tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * i have had many saganaki in various countries. this ranked as one of the very worst! i made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. bottom line:  horrific !!!",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
