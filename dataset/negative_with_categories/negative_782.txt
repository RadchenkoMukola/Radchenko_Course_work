"the coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. if you're a local i get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. i really wanted to like tazza d'oro. i've been several times hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. i drink espresso. i know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. i have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and i let you know you should probably try again. the last time i went in both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso i ordered. the gentlemen working there who was very nice pulled my shot. i tried it and it was very sour. i let the girl standing directly in front of me know that i didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment ya well we just got it. silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you just got to taste good...this place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. it's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. it's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
