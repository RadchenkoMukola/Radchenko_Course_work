"i've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  it's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the strip.  i end up at roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  they have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail so i ordered those.  the oysters were absolutely disgusting.  they were not fresh or cleaned very well.  my fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross gritty taste to them.  they threw the poorly deveined shrimp on ice and it ended up soggy.  i had to pick the veins out myself and after about two i lost my appetite.  as always the service was terrible.  next time i'm dragged to a happy hour there i'll order water.  never again will i spend money in this place.  yuck!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
