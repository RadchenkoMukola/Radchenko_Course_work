"below par diner food. fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. anything fried always comes dripping in grease i know i know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. i'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. small portion with very little meat and dry bread.besides the food the service is so so. last time i was in i asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich and this was on a slow daywith eat n park down the street and pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. i'm giving it one star because i can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
