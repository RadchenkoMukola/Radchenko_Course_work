"i tried pickles tonight for the first time.  i called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  i got there and was told it would be another 10.   it was another 20 before i got my food.  in a bad frame of mind i tried my food.  i must admit it was good.  not great but good.  i didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  i dig that kind of place.  but if you tell someone a time you should be able to deliver.  the food itself warrents a higher rating but the overall experience was a disappointment.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
