"unbelievably bad! if the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. the egg rolls have only cabbage in them. the chicken is dark fatty and inedible. don't miss the 100 pound tub of msg as you walk in. i paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach food was then delivered i took one look at it and threw it out and left. you should skip this place for sure.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
