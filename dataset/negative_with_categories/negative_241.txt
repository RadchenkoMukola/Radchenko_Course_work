"i understand primanti is a historic institution here in pittsburgh but other than the name i don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. i got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when i moved here. really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. i went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw tomato french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as i finished the second half. the sheer size of it all was just too much too. i wouldn't return again though if you're visiting and into doing pittsburgh touristy stuff i would say you would need to experience primanti to judge for yourself.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
