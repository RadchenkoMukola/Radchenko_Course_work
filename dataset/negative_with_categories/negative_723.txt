"there were 3 of us on a beautiful sunday afternoon. surprisingly roland's was 3/4 full. with 3 waitresses. they were running to fill orders. the fish was hot and crispy. it was fried but it was good. the french fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. the mussels were ok. but the clams casino were inedible. the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. the crab cakes were also bad. both went back.  the waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. the new england clam chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. no we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at wholleys) and the service was terrible. it took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
