"i have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years i have lived in pittsburgh but after this last visit never again! the woman working there was so rude i could hardly believe it. a gentleman came in speaking spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking english she was still rude to him.  i accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) i apologized profusely and felt so bad i bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. after i walked out i realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! i guess i should have just walked out without buying stuff. its a shame because they are close to where i live but next time i'll take the trip to one of the mexican groceries in brookline.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
