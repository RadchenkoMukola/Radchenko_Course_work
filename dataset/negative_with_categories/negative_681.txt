"located right next to pnc park so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. that and outdoor seating are main perks. otherwise food and prices are not worth a stop. this place will fill up on game day but should be avoided when the pirates aren't in town. it isn't a bad experience. if you are siting outside and you have a view of pittsburgh it can't be that bad.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
