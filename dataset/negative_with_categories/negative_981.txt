"i had heard lots of good things about vento's. unfortunately i did not get to experience these things. the service was slow and lukewarm. the pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. also no credit or debit cards here.  you're directed to the atm in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   i ordered ahead and although i had to wait for my pizza when i got there i received it cold and it just was not that good.  i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
