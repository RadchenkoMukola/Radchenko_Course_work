"i'm going to revise my review of quiet storm.you may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. in my experience however (considering the 30+ cubanos i've eaten there) you're more likely to get a sad mediocre rendition.consistency is not their strong point.add to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude and i've decided to steer clear.it's a shame that i no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at quiet storm. it's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful friendly and helpful and yet their efforts are overshadowed.sorry quiet storm. as a pittsburgh vegetarian i want to love you. but you broke my heart.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
