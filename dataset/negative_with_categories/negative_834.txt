"visited the dave and busters in homestead pa last night. waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. charged them already too - both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it was. waitress never apologized. gm was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. after spending over $300 plus games we will never go back. whatever happened to the customer is always right? horrible service",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
