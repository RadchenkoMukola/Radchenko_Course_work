"i am not impressed.  the food was so-so and my boyfriend and i had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. i bought it that morning sorry if it should have been taken off the website but you should honor it. i would not pay their full price for it but with a nice coupon then maybe it could be worth it. the quality of the food was not good enough to outweigh the service.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
