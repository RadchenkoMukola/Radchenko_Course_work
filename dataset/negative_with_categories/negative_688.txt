"yuck!it's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the strip with so many tourists coming here.  that has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  well maybe it's the booze too...i don't even know where to begin.  service was horrible.  the lunch took 2 hours.  on a leisurely sunday that may be fine but there was no leisure.  at least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  i'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  it didn't matter though i knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  i'd heard rumors about the food.  i won't go into any details but i wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  i just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  the salad was in the entree section so i assumed it would be a full size salad.  it was not.  it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  nothing spectacular.  and a side salad at almost $11.  not worth it.  if you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger stick to a liquid diet:)",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
