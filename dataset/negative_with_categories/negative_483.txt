"completely agree with deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce too.  i know it was only $4/$7 for a 6/12 sub but it was pretty bad.  (i bought a 12 intending to take half home for later but i wound up throwing the second half away and i never throw away food.)  as a italian grocery it seems okay but the attitudes are a little snippy and it's a pretty grungy-looking place.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
