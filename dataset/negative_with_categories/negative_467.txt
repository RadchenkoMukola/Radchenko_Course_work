"i have always had a great dinner at mitchell's but something has changed. went there last night about 5:30 the place was maybe half full. we were seated and when it finally occurred to us that no one had been to the table at all to ask about drinks or even bring water i started timing.... 14 minutes later we decided to leave. told the hostess what had happened and got a blank stare.  sorry but not going back there again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
