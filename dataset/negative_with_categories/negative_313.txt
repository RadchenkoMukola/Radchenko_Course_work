"i have eaten here twice. both times i thought the food was sub-par. the first time was a birthday lunch that was lousy but i was feeling under the weather so i gave it another try about a year later for dinner. it was just as lousy as the lunch. my wife definitely agreed and although we can walk there in 15 minutes we will never eat there again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
