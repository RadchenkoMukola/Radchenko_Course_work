"i was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice sunny day and we decided to drive to waterfront and walk around. all around great day until we hit bar louie for some drinks and appetizers.i am giving it one star though it deserves none because our waitress was nice if a bit inattentive and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired.this is probably the first place i've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. to me that is beyond ridiculous. bar louie is not an upscale restaurant as much as they wish they were and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. as i mentioned the waitress was friendly but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. i really wanted to like this place because of things i had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good but if it want to spend that kind of money i'll go somewhere that i can get good service.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
