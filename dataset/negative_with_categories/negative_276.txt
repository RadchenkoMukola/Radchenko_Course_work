"wow just wow. that was without a doubt the worst pizza i've ever had in my life. maybe you would like it. do you like all of your toppings out of a can? i didn't even know you could get canned green bell peppers. do you like your slices of pizza to be covered with a huge several inch thick mound of uncooked mozzarella cheese? if answer is yes then maybe this place is for you. it is definitely not for me.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
