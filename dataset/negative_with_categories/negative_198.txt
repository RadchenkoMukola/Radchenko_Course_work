"we had a frustrating and disappointing experience at roland's a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to pittsburgh.first all of the food was extremely overpriced. the quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. the $16 i paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. i couldn't have tried to make food this poor. it was a sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from houlihan's mixed with joe's crab shack. the service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. my dish arrived without any sort of sauce and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. it was her second day on the job but this is unacceptable. they could have at least comp'd our beers or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).roland's had space available on a monday night unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. this was really convenient initially but i now have an idea of why this was the case.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
