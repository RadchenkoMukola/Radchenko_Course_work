"i have been going to benihana's back when it was samuri... i visit the cleveland and pittsburgh one frequently. the cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. i keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. they have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. the shrimp the order they give you the food the way the cut the veggies. im becoming a huge fan of itchiban both the one in robinson and cranberry its cheaper and you get more food for your money . i hope beni's changes. i even e mailed them and they didnt respond .",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
