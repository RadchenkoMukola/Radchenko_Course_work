"worst pizza i've had in pittsburgh. i ordered from here last weekend. the pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. the buffalo wings were cooked well and were tender and juicy but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily i had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. maybe it was one bad night and i can give them another chance later but based on my one experience i can't recommend this place to anyone.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
