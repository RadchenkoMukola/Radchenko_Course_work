"i'm picky about the quality of meat so i was disappointed when i specifically asked if the chicken parmesan sub had whole breast meat the cashier said yes then it turned out to be school cafeteria style chicken patty with bread crumb filler. yuck i should've trusted my gut and ordered the eggplant parm. k got the italian sub. it was ok not the greatest. i recommend trying a different cheap eats if you're downtown.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
