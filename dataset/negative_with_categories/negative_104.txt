"don't do it! the ribs are average at best. the sides are just as average as well. the bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. the greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it. this place is almost as bad as the now closed mr willie's bbq in squirrel hill! i had such high hopes for this place. oh well. that's what i get for trying to cheat on showcase bbq in homewood. now those are the best ribs in pittsburgh and some of the best in the country! they don't take debit or credit cards. cash only!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
