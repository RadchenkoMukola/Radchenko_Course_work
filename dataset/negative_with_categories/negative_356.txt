"this restaurant is horrible.  the waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  the only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  how can you call yourself an oyster house and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  the food overall was ok.  i would never go or eat there again!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
