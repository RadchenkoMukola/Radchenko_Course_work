"i came here on the fourth of july after getting off of work. my friend and i stopped for one drink before the fireworks. let's just say i will never return. i stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. the bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. they then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. it took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. i am a bartender and i am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. i am a phenomenal tipper being that i am in the industry and sadly i didn't leave a single dollar. hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  what a shame.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
