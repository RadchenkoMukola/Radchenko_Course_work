"okay so i just moved to the outskirts of duquesne pa which is outside of pittsburgh from harrisburg pa of all places. where i am at really there is no delivery but these guys did. they were nice and cordial and cheap but i have been spoiled by the pizza shop in harrisburg downtown run my an old world italian guy named luigi. that pizza is/was miles better than this. this crust while thin did not have flavor and was hard. the slices were small for their 8 slice which i did like. the cheese was good. the sauce was meh. i've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
