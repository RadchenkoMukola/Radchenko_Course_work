"we went on a saturday night. we were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but it was likely closer to 45-50 minutes. the food is just average. nothing special. didn't seem handmade or anything like that. i thought they were known for their lasagna...so i got that. blah...average.service was incredibly slow. i don't think the waiter checked on us once.i probably wouldn't go back.visited october 2014",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
