"i am kind to all service workers! always! this place has the worst service i have ever seen. i do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. you better check your bag because they are going to forget something. yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi. okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? he was told to go down the street there is a store. this is inside not the drive thru. it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. i already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. and yes i have contacted the corp. i dont want anything from them though they can keep it.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
