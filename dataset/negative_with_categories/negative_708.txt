"pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-italian smart casual neighborhood restaurant and it's literally just that. translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. a relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients recipes and presentation though the service was refreshingly excellent. unfortunately the only other reason you'd be dining in point breeze would be to enjoy the amazing point brugge cafe just down the street. as a previous reviewer mentioned i stopped in simply because the brugge was full but i unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
