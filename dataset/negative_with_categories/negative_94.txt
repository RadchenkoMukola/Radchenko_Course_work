"this is an average chinese buffet. the food was not bad but not impressive neither plus some cheap american food. the food was a little too greasy even by american chinese food standard and my stomach complained soon after i left that place. to me that's a no-go signal.on the other hand they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door perhaps the food would be better there.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
