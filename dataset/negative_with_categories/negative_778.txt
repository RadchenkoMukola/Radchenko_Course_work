"i have to admit i kind of thought benihana was fictitious until we moved to pittsburgh... and then low and behold there was one right near where we live. the food is okay. there are better hibachi options in the area. the service can be okay or awful. one time we were there with our kids and had an absolutely evil waitress. one of my kids isn't a big eater so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal we just got a side order of rice and soup. the kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream so when we were done with dinner we asked if she could get ice cream as well. i don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no we absolutely could not order ice cream separately. you either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. wtf?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
