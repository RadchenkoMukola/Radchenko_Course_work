"food: there are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores but the food is only so-so.  we've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity and nothing has been bad but nothing has been special.  the general tso's tofu and the moo shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  the eggplant was soggy and not great.  the portions are large.  nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.price: tasty is cheap.  drinks: n/aatmosphere: typical chinese takeout place.  a photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  located in the plaza next to pizza parma.  decent location for that end of shadyside.service: the employees speak poor english but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  the food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.(+): many options cheap ready quickly(-): food is nothing to write home aboutwould i go back again? if i'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
