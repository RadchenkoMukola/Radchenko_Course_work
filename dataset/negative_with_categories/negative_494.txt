"i came here for my birthday dinner.  i was not impressed at all.  first off we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  he seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  i did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  however food wise it was just ok and a bit disappointing.  i of course had filet and i was just so underwhelmed with it.  the flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  after this experience i have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
