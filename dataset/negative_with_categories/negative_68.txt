"i was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. the air conditioning was non existent which is a hangover nightmare. while waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. he also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! i'm not a beer drinking novice. the acne-ridden server was friendly enough but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and i don't drink tap water. after sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. appetizer - crab artichoke dip. bland. where's the crab? also did a toddler arrange the plate? apparently. meal - fish tacos. came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. however our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. i shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. no tip never coming back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
