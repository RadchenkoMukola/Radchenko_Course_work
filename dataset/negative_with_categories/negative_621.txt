"i travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  i was in town on a business trip and someone recommended roland's seafood grill.  i was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  i noticed the beer sampler and thought i would give it a try. i asked the server if i could choose the beers and she said yes.  she went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers i selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps. i ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  they were cold but did not taste fresh.  next i ordered the famous lobster roll which comes with fries and slaw.  it took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  the fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  the lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of texas toast.  it was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  the lobster inside was a small amount cold and tough. the slaw was reasonably good and cold. the server came back and i ordered a pint of draft beer.  after nearly another 20 minutes she returned apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of guinness instead of the draft i ordered.  at this point i politely explained i did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.  i would be hard pressed to ever return.  with other great restaurant choices in the area i don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at roland's seafood grill.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
