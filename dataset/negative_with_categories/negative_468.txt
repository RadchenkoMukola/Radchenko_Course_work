"4.5 stars????   really?????  based on what?   the food is okay but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.  the staff is friendly.  the prices are all right for what you get.  what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating.  the seats at the counter were torn and tilting off the base.  the booths were fast-food style: hard and tight.  it's as if they designed the seating to be uncomfortable so that you wouldn't linger.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
