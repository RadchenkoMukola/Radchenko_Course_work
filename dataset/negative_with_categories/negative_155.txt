"i love steak n shake. this one however leaves a lot to be desired. the food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. most of the time they're downright rude. i highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. there's one on route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
