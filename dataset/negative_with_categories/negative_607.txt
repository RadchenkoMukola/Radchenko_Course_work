"i stopped by here this past tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  my fiance a friend and i were trying pizza from three different places and luigi's was one of them.  i have driven by luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever i was looking for a pizza place i had not yet tried in the bellevue area.  whenever i called to place my order i was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  i arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever i walked into the restaurant.  you see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and i didn't immediately see the are where i would get my pizza from.  finally after a few steps into the restaurant i noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where i needed to be and i made my way back there.  my pizza was ready for me and i quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me stay out of trouble.  i really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  the pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since i could see a ton of green herbs in it.  the cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which i did not enjoy.  out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.the bottom line for me is that i will probably not head back to luigi's in the future.  i just don't see myself making a trip to luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that i had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
