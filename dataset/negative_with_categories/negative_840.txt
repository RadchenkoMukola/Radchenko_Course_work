"my food was plain and boring. our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. the dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. the manager on duty did apologize but that was it. there was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. fortunately no one was seriously injured but i really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. the place was noisy and it was pricey.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
