"i decided to try this place after reading on yelp how good it is.  this is no mike and tony's or big greek gyro in market square.  i won't be back.  they only take cash. the workers are not greek chefs and are very condescending.   the gyro sandwich for $5 was ok at best.  they threw some tomatoes on it. the sauce could be better.  the fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  i asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. it was definitely not heinz which is a sin in pittsburgh!   i had to hunt silverware and straws.  you would think they would give them to you with the meal.  they charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  they put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  you can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  they are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  tables were not very clean.  i was surprised at the number of patrons.  this place is definitely regularly visited. they have daily specials but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food.  they get a c from me.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
