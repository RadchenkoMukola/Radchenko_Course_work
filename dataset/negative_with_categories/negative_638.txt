"always love primanti's and i was central pittsburgh area so i went for lunch. it was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. i was told to sit myself which is cool since i wanted to sit outside. but then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. finally a third came and took my order. i got my usual.... pastrami extra cheese no tomato add egg. when did she miss the no tomato? i got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. i immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again mia. she just disappeared again. i waited as long as i could but she never came back. i finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook i needed a new piece of bread. he gave it to me with a funny look then i ate my sammich and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. until then she was just missing. i was so annoyed but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. a few minutes later i needed my bill but guess what she was gone again! i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. i was really annoyed. love me some primantis but the market square one has terrible service.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
