"meh.  i've experience better. i find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  i think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the like of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food and it's not something i'd think about again when i leave but i wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  they staff is nice when it's busy they're a little slow.  the food is spicy like the guacamole and house salsa - i like spicy but it didn't really add flavor just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good but strong w/ low-end tequila yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  the pico de gallo my alternative to the spicy salsa was as bland as they come so i settled on virgin chips.  everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
