"let's see....an italian restaurant in pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own italian cooking show? should be great right? not so much.went here recently and ordered the pasta trio since this is apparently what one gets at lidias. perhaps i went on the wrong day but i thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce pesto sauce and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. at the very least there are italian restaurants in pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.the one positive to lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. i had a bite of a chocolate torte and was very impressed. the coffee with grappa was also quite nice.all things told though i would spend my money elsewhere.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
