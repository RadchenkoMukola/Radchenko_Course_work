"i have a love-hate relationship with this place...  i love it because it's extremely close to me (so it's convenient when i'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on sundays is outstanding.  i'm a giant steeler fan but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in buffalo blues which gives it a fun and exciting feel during nfl sundays.  however i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  the food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if i thought it was worth the price but i don't.  not even a little bit.  the only thing i have found to be delicious there were the wings; however you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  so it's not really much of a win at all.  also i want to have a handful of beers during the games but i don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  so all in all i recommend going once and awhile (mainly on sundays) for a beer or two but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
