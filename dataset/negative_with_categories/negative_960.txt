"lamb burger was outright bad(tasted off and charred). we shared and together only ate half. the filet was decent but not $25 worth of decent. waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. there are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion this isn't one of them.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
