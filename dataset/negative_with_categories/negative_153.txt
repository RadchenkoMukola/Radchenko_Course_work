"well i have had several meals over the years at rolands many of which were good.  yesterday was not one of those days.after being seated it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  i was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.then we order and when the food arrived the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.i wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  my mother who had the same food as i did is feeling the same as me.get your act together rolands you are better than this.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
