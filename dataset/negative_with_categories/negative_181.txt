"went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. the server was very friendly but seemed a little overwhelmed. maybe they were short handed.  the food was to me not even average. i ordered a burger which very overdone and dry. had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  my friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle then put cheese and one jalape√±o slice on each piece. imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  not like any nachos i've ever seen and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
