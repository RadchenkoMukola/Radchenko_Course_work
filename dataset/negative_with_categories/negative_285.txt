"found the place to be average at best. pancakes were not very good. they tasted like they were made from a mix mushy in the middle and they came with powdered sugar which i don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. oj was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. i like the fact the place is not a chain and i'd be up for trying other food there but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
