"right so......first off hire employees that actually appreciate having a job.  not ones that are there because they are forced to.  that way maybe you can actually earn a decent review.  if you start off with a bad experience with an employee you're not going to get a great review.i went here midday on a sunday.  thought that was a great idea especially when i got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before i am even acknowledge that i am there.  finally order and pull around i wait another five minutes.  i could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me or if the sit down area inside was packed but there was no one else there but me.i'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.  all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine.  i was made to feel like i was interrupting her day and that i should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.you know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes i just used that word)?  leaving the drive thru driving the distance to my house walking into my house sitting down to feed my face and find that part of my order wasn't given to me.  *enter angry expletives here*i doubt i'll be revisiting this location again i'll drive the further distance from my place the next time i'm craving a taco or two.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
