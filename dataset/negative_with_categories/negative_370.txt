"max's was good but i've had better.the restaurant is located in a tired part of town. it isn't in a bad area but i'm not sure how i would feel eating there after dark. when you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant which is dark and gloomy. we were escorted to the rear of the tavern which is covered in b&w pictures from the 40's which gives it a old world tired feeling.the menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. i had max's goulash which said it came with spaetzle but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side which was okay. the goulash was too vinegary for my tastes but it was okay.my wife's jaeger schnitzel was good but i've had better at das wald cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/das-waldcafe-newport-news).",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
