"i really enjoyed my mongolian beef and pork pot stickers but there was no presentation of pfc mixing sauces. one of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill non franchise is presentation and experience.  i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation. reservations:our party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.at 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . obviously someone dropped the ball here.....when we requested silverware for the table. our waitress blamed it on the hostess. yes thehostess should have provided silverware.. however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. as a patron i could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. defiantly took away from my pfc experience.my hot and sour soup is usally served withnoodley things that i drop in the soup. we weren't given any noodley  things . not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. this experience is what sets this restaurant apart.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
