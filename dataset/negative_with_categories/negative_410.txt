"walked in tonight wednesday at 9:50 the place was empty. asked for a table the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. when she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  didn't say a word to us. unbelievable!  will not be back there-- rude hostess!",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
