"we were huge fans of pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. in all honesty we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying  we have to get to pinos! needless to say we were disappointed.  the place has changed and not for the better.  it seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  the menu has been scaled back considerably.  though the food was adequate it's not the same.  i came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case i doubt we will return.  hopefully things will change back to how they were.  customer advice for what it's worth.  refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
