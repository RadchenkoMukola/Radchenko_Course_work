"my husband and i have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. sweet potato fries were not edible. we ate at a table at the bar and told andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a bad meal be warned!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
