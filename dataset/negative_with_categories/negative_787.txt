"this is one of the most over hyped restaurant that i have ever been to.  i know it's a pittsburgh legend. i have been there several times and every time say to myself i won't be going back.  i only go there when dragged by coworkers.  the restaurant is always packed service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches but the sandwiches are horrible.  burnt roast beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
