"the home-cooked breakfasts at the rusty nail in bellevue are wonderful prices are reasonable the wait staff are gems and is often bragged about by bellevue locals.  that said two stars is all i can muster primarily due to the tiny cramped dining area.  i've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.don't get me wrong i adore that pittsburgh is a small friendly city but i'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs nor knowing his guest gargled with cool mint listerine this morning (or worse didn't) .  yes the tables are packed that close together.  and whatever you do don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
