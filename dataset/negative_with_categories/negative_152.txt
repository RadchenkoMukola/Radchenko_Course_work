"pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. have a drink and enjoy the deck but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  the menu is blah and the food is also.i recently had lunch here and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely bringing food to everyone else at the table.  when i reminded her she returned with my clam chowder spilled it didn't apologize and didn't clean it up.  all that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
