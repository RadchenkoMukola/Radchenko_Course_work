"this has always been my 'go to' place to buy the most awesome authentic flour tortillas.  i always  bought them fresh still warm at times.  i have often served them at my  home and have sent many friends to shop there. yesterday i raved about how wonderful they were to a total stranger and we both bought 2 packages from 'the fridge up front'.  i was so so very disappointed and if the person i 'sold' them to reads yelp i apologize. they were dry and stale.  steaming them made them somewhat edible but.....which leads to my next review....i was so excited when they opened their restaurant as they sell  such tasty tacos on the street.  i have been there 3 times.  first off the  best margarita!  food ok but service......horrible!!  the most efficient wait staff appears to be a 10-12 year old boy who has made our guacamole and aims to please.  when we were there over the weekend the waiter outside  could do nothing more than tell us how busy he was and how he had to take the steps with each order. he got our salsa order wrong so needless to say we left. this makes me sad to write this. did they bite off more than  they can chew?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
