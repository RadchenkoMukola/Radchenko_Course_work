"they must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant.  the chicken parmigiana was very bready and i question if it was homemade.  i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  the homemade bread was very sorry.....  not worth the price.  the decor is very plain.  service was fine.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
