"the food here is pretty good but the service was some of the worst i've ever experienced. our wait just to place drink orders was almost 15 minutes had i not been exhausted from my drive in from columbus i probably would have left then. however we stayed the waitress was slow forgetful we had to yell for her or wave our arms if we needed anything. at one point the poor people next to us who had also received terrible service were asked by the waitress a full 15 minutes after she placed their order if she had gotten their orders. i probably won't visit this location again on my next pittsburgh trip.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
