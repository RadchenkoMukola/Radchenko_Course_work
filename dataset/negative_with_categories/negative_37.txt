"after seeing a google offer for miller's my mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood.  so i offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  once we were seated and greeted by our waitress we presented the paperwork for our google offer.  the waitress handed it to the hostess.  i guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  in the end she talked to someone and figured it out but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  or she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  i later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - i guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  apparently with this kind of reception no one wants to pay full price.mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  the mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  i ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  we left with full and happy tummies.to comment on previous reviews....yes this is not the cleanest place.  but i expected that and find it part of the charm.  the smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.overall it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  i'd like to give it 3 stars at least but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
