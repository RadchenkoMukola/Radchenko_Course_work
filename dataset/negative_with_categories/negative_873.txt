"ok i am trying to catch up on my reviews and since coming back from vaca in great sf and i have jetlag with nothing else to at the moment i am trying to do just that. my husband and i have eaten at rcsh over the years and with each visit the service has gotten increasingly worse! the food is wonderful as always but really with our dinners averaging 200 plus tip i believe the service should be topnotch. what happened rc???? we love your food but can't justify the prices with service so bad. we should not have to keep looking around for our waiter for a drink refill and we told numerous times we would like bread with our meal and when we brought it up to him his reply was oh the bread is done yet and no reply about the drinks...sad...too busy talking with the other staff(this did happen last october before the yo-yo ma concert we attended) hey maybe they have improved..but ah we are not taking anymore chances with this place!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
