"i hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  but after reading the other reviews i thought eh what the hell.we came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   by 6:05 we still hadn't seen our waitress.  we decided it wasn't worth it and just left.i did eat here a month ago and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  and then to pay around $20 for that?  lol.  right.i won't be back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
