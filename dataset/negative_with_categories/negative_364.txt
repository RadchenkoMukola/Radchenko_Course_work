"the wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. the strange hostesses seated my party of 4 & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. ordered an app & left 25 minutes later the lobster nachos never came which sucked because i was quote excited about those. the place is gross! there was food & trash all over the floor & i watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. this was confirmed by my wife. skip this place & go anywhere else in the strip district",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
