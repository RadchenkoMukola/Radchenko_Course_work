"by far the worst mcdonald's in the world.  employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter to get your order correct.  ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order after waiting what seems an eternity.  i've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru only to get home and find no beef patties on my big mac.  save yourself the aggravation and do not go here.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
