"i took my parents out to celebrate the christmas season.  my mother ordered the petite filet mignon which she thought was very good.  the sides we ordered - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were also good.  however my father and i shared the porterhouse for two.  for $90 i would have expected a much better piece of meat.  flavor was good but it was tough.  there were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife.  in addition the presentation was poor.  they put a big plate in the center of the table then cut up the steak into 10 or 12 cubes.  these cubes were then cooked.  i could have done better at home.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
