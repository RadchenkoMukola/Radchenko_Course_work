"awful service; took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items (then added a few beers we didn't order on to our tab; i'm assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice.) then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check? in the time we argued about it you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.had to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch. i would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if i could have; but we got gratted so i didn't even have that option.if you want to come here with more than 3 people avoid d's. their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer i can get at sharp edge for $6? no thanks!) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in pittsburgh.in other words don't come here. i used to like this place but tonight was such a bad experience i'll just go to one of the other places in pittsburgh that serves hot dogs french fries and beer. there are plenty of them i won't miss d's at all.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
