"they charge $4 for a hot dog that is not any different from one you can get at any 7/11 for $1.  not sure how to review it other than to say have you ever gone into any gas station convenience store in america and gotten a big dog or whatever and put condiments on it?  it's the same thing but 3 more dollars.  they did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive.i hate supporting chains but independent places are supposed to offer something more unique than a neato neon sign.  you might pay as much for a dog in chicago or new york but they're something special.  for less the amount i could have gotten a corn beef sandwich at various places nearby.  liked the people and the atmosphere.  next time i'll try the ice cream.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
