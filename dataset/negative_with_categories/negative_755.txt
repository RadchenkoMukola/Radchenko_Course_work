"if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them go for it.   but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that.  these are not very good sandwiches to begin with and adding soggy fries doesn't help.  not to mention the bread is not fresh and is just a thick bland wonder-bready thing.  i appreciate that they're not aiming at  customers like me.  big sloppy sandwiches are fun for a lot of people so i hate to be a party pooper but i don't think the quality is there.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
