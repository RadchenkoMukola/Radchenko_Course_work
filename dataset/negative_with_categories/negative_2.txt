"i use to love rolands. however the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  while the food remains okay the service leaves something to be desired.  our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  she did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  the waitress was rude and less than helpful.  our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  good thing they still have a good bloody mary.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
