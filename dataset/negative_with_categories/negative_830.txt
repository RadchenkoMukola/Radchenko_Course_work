"we've eaten a number of superb meals at the morton's in cincinnati and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at morton's in pittsburgh. oh boy. the ambiance is more like a wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped busy somewhat noisy. of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes medium rare) one was horribly overcooked the other one a little on the rare side. the meat wasn't special. the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme. service was ok but occasionally inattentive. for two adults one child a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. it ended up being $350 or so. oh well - i rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. imagine my shock when i found that my credit card had been charged with $600! i'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head they need to call chef ramsey.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
