"clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. whenever i go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments i order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. since it was 11 in the morning i chose not to order primanti's #1 best seller which the waitress told me was beer but perhaps that would have made my experience better. as it was i ordered the #2 best seller the cheese steak. it was heinous. think a grimy mechanically separated salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced italian bread served signature primanti-style: with coleslaw tomatoes and fries.first the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit which i'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something i'm trying to eat) with a gross processed meat texture. secondly the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich with their old fryer grease taste. additionally the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait i don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. my dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches respectively. easily the best part of the meal was the smallman street fries and those were equally lack-luster. the bacon was simply bacon bits (oh the humanity!) the chili was uninspired and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  i will never go back and i will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks primanti bros. produces decent food.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
