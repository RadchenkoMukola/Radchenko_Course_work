"i went to rock bottom this past weekend and it was nice to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. while the beer is pretty good it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average at best.it was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed the men tried...that didn't work either. if we hadn't really wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv we would've just left. it definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender so i can't overlook it. of course the service has always been spotty at rock bottom so it was hardly surprising.combine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
