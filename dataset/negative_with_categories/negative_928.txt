"i'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review but whatever. i was told by several people that i absolutely had to check out primanti bros while i was in pittsburgh. i was excited about visiting this institution during my stay... but it really didn't deliver for me. yes this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland. maybe i just got the wrong thing (the pittsburger cheese steak - which is somehow their #2 seller...?). my friend liked her sandwich which was eggs and bacon i believe. maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location. i would give this place another shot if i'm ever in town again but my first impression wasn't a great one.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
