"there are only so many ways to make the american bastardized version of a pizza but for some reason there are as many pizza shops as there are stars in a clear night sky. as they may be stunning to behold from afar each one is pretty much the same thing. this shop is another place that tosses sauce and cheese on bread and serves it to their patrons. ok so they do have a slightly different take throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. this does not melt the cheese and i do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese.  some customers may like it me not so much. i tried the italian hoagie.  it was a good size and the meat was flavorful. but that's about it. they put oil on the sandwich but no other dressing. i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. i didn't sample it he liked it but it was way too messy. the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  the staff did seem pretty nice even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant. the dining room is also a bit cramped. there are plenty of booths but the tables are rather close together and hard to maneuver between. hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain. when they are busy it is a claustrophobic nightmare.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
