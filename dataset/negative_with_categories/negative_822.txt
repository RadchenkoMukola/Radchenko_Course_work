"went here this past saturday afternoon 11/2. my friends and i sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. the bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. as we walked out we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. we went next door to mad mex and got much better service!",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
