"hostess was very awkward when seating us. sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. the place was by no means busy. we sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. we watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. after 15 minutes of being ignored by staff we got up and walked out. it's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. don't think we'd ever come back after that. there are plenty of other places.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
