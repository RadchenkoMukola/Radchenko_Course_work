"to keep it short and sweet: save yourself $100. buy a good board game your alcohol of choice order a pizza and invite your friends over. what an incredible disappointment. after seeing the enticing commercials so many times we decided to give this place a try on a double date. i understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however the food was incredibly over-priced came out cold (as in sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and i literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. it was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (not to mention my glass was dirty and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappointed as i was.) the service was terrible. don't ask for anything from your waiter as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? yes. if you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games i suppose i would advise you give it a shot. i would never recommend their food customer service or drinks. save yourself the money and stay home or go for a traditional bowling figure skating roller-blading rock climbing basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
