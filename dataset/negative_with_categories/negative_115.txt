"overall my experience was okay. we sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and helpful. we got the scallop appetizer and it was to die for! i will 100% go back for that! that being said it was downhill from there. we got the lobster roll and lobster ravioli...and both were ehhh. the lobster roll had a ton of lobster on it (yeah!) but there wasn't any other seasoning or any type of dressing to tie it all together. the lobster  ravioli was the biggest disappointment because it had absolutely no flavor....i had to grab the salt shaker and even then it barely had a taste. i can't even comment on the lobster inside of the ravioli because the whole thing just tasted like nothing.i'll go back for the scallops but wouldn't recommend anything else.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
