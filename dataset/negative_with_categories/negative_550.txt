"from reading other reviews and dining guides it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking or you don't. i fall into the later category: i didn't like it at all.i ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. for the pizza the crust was salvageable after i pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). the salad was...nothing short of horrific. overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. eventually i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.i don't get this place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
