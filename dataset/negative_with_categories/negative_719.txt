"yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  that being said i cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs i saw in such a short period of time.  all gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows what's going on in the kitchen?  not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table.  i killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a (spec) of blood. disgusting. a manager (looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do i know) did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didn't accomplish much no free meal or anything.  i noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
