"many great memories and great experience at benihana but last night was not! horrible service! took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when i had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal could he go find.. no! told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. really?!? then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini where's the veggies?? from start to finish it was about half an hour! if we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. so we ate as we went. also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! we had 3 birthdays at our table.. not one song  which i didn't care not one complimentary picture no dessert was offered until another customer said something. then the bill.. oh the bill... that took another 15 mins!! at this point i told my family to go ahead home and i will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. i was double charged on two items. at this point i was done dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. rectified the errors. and was generous with a $20 refund! i told him about the experience and all he said was i can take picture now for you um... i was by myself!!! no thanks! one last thing the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. he was high as a kite and made my daughter & i feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post. wow & boo!!! and sad : (",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
