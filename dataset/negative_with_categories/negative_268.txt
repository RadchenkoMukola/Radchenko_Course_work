"awful service overpriced food. don't waste your money! on arrival waitress seemed lost.  ordered food for 3 adults one kid food came for adults after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming waitress said she would check came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. cancelled the pizza paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it fried shrimp was expense but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. spoke to manager who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. if you give these people your money it would be foolish!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
