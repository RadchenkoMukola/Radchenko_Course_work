"in general i do like shake n' steak but this location is a hit or miss location!  you never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  a friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there ever!  you can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. however while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  the burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...by far my worst visit to steak n' shake!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
