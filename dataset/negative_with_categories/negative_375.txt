"meh i just don't see the appeal bar louis has to pittsburghers. i guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the waterfront stopping in after a shift. it's always packed. being so close to the amc theater they get traffic before and after movies. it's expensive the food is so so. before i get ahead of myself i had the bbq ranch chicken salad without chicken. the bbq ranch dressing was very good but it's very easy to duplicate at home. it's equal parts ranch dressing and kc masterpiece hickory bbq sauce and a drop or two of worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight daily drink and happy hour selections but even that's not enough to get me here. skip it. one caveat for this location free parking. at station square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.i'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when burgatory opens across the street.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
