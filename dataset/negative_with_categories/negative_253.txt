"very disappointing meal.  after waiting for a half hour my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. very awkward.t.  salad was average at best.  the beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.  then to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  the chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? to make matters worse when paying the bill the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  it was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. he kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. i think i would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.long story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
