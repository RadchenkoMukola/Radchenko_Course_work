"after reading old reviews i figured that some change had to have occurred over the last year and gave it a shot. went with my boyfriend after biking along the north shore trail and didn't tell him about the negative reviews since i really wanted to sit along the river. the view/environment is still very pretty but we both found ourselves displeased with the food and the service. we both got the beer battered cod sandwhich (convinced him to go basic after reading bad things about the food) and although he enjoyed it i thought the batter was very doughy and uncooked on the fish and the tartar sauce tasted grainy (any giant eagle brand would have been better). it didn't seem like others were too crazy about the food as i heard the woman behind us complaining that her dish wasn't cooked and would like a refund. the beers were bottled and cold so couldn't complain there but the service was still poor as we were rushed to choose our drinks/dishes and given a second to pay. would have thought after all the reviews that they would have changed employees. overall i would come here again only for some beers and nice seating but would eat dinner beforehand.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
