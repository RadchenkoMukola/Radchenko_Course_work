"first time i've eaten here i went during lunch time. not crowded but service was quite slow so i took off a star. my girlfriend ordered from their sushi lunch special and i ordered the bison burger. you're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. well i originally planned on fish but i hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. well the menu is a bit pricey and i don't mind paying for good food so i had high expectations. he bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) the menu said bacon but none showed up. no worries probably better for me. i felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. not the case. i would put it at $8.99-$9.99 price range i would pay since they gave me chips as a side. so they lost another star for over priced for the value i received. the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. this would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. so ultimately would i give it another shot? yes but only if it is convenient. i would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place.  helpful advice for the ofm.  actually have lunch specials. if you charge the prices you charge the food needs to be worth the price or you will lose return customers. two rolls of sushi and a burger shouldn't cost me $33 unless you are going to blow minds!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
