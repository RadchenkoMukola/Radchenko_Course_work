"so an honest review.  bland.  service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made.  i ordered the new black bean burger sandwich.  bread not toasted burger tasted a lot like my morning star black bean burger that i get frozen.  cole sale was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it.  the best part was by far the fries which weren't all that great.  i am glad that those were home made.  i picked all the bread off ate mostly the fries and was not very impressed.  the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating.  i'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better.  i still ate because i was hungry and it's not uneatable just bland and kinda of boring.  it's still a must do in pitts so go ahead and do it at least once but skip the rest of your stay.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
