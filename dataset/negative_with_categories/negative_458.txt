"i have been to rolands a few times and have not experienced any of the problems others are saying they have however i'm only giving 2 stars because you're in the strip-you can do better than rolands! i was most recently at rolands during the steeler season last year. i ordered the crab chowder which i have had every time i have been there and each time it has been excellent. on this most recent visit i ordered the raspberry maple scallop appetizer as my meal. it was a large portion;i could not finish it and my fellow diners were too stuffed to help me. one member of my group ordered the seafood pizza and crushed it-said it was so tasty. my other fellow diner order the stuffed banana pepper app and also said it was good. they have a wide draft selection and if you get there early enough you can grab a seat near the tvs. the bar is usually too crowded to grab a seat at but our service at our table was attentive and quick. on a previous visit i split a margarita pizza and it was good too so there is a variety of entrees/apps etc to choose from to please any palate.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
