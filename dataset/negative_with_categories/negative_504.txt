"i would give them zero stars if it were an option. no one came to wait on us. i had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. we'll call him mr. personality because he never did tell us his name. i should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. my caesar salad came without the requested onions. my grilled salmon was overcooked. the vegetables were bland. the waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. he never offered us dessert. the rest rooms were filthy. i would never recommend this place to anyone.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
