"soho was disappointing. lunch was very crowded so we sat at the bar even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. we were just 4 but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. it was also very loud for a weekday the noise from other tables carrying easily.i ordered the french dip sandwich with risotto on the side. to their credit the risotto was delicious but such a tiny portion i inhaled it in no time. especially considering the french dip was so boring. the meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. not to mention the food is definitely over-priced. i don't think i'd go back but if i did i'd order the risotto and nothing else.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
