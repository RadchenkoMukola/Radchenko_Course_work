"the food was fine. it's a chain. i'm not rating it. the service was absolutely horrible. it started well enough when we ordered lunch but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. between being ignored by the girl at the counter her not listening to the order then arguing with me when i told her i did not ask for what she brought me i really can't decide which is worse. i rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business rather than take attitude from panera employees.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
