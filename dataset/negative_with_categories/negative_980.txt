"summary:if i was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go i might come back for beer and appetizers.good:- decent beer...- original pretzel appetizer.  you take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.- huge portions.  most of us had leftovers.  the rb appetizer sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  the half order of ribs looked like a full rack.- attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.- amusing name.bad:- lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  i guess this could be seen as good but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.- none of the food was super awesome.  nothing was awful but nothing stood out in any way.  i've had better beer appetizers and a better main course at plenty of breweries.- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.come if you want bar food but keep your expectations low.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
