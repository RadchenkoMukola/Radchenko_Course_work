"okay so i've heard a lot of good things about this place. and i wanted to like it!but it was seriously bad. i very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because i don't like it. but i couldn't eat it. i got the shadyside and it was super greasy and the flavor just wasn't there. my roommate got the portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.the guy who served us was cool beans though.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
