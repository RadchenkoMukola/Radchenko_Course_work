"worst service ever.  the waitress and i use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  when she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  i'm glad i don't live in pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
