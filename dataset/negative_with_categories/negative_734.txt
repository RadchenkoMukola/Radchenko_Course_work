"i lived off of pickles in college!  the only downfall was their delivery time.  it always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food 10 minutes down the road. i moved still in delivery distance and had a terrible experience.i called my order in and had a total of 11 and some change.  i told them i'd be laying cash.  when the delivery guy arrived he couldn't stop complaining about walking up my steps and i would have to meet him downstairs next time.  when i handed him a 20 he told me sorry i don't have any change.  so he walked off with a 9 dollar tip after being terribly late rude and forgot my drink.good food but rude service on the phone and in person. i have not been back since.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
