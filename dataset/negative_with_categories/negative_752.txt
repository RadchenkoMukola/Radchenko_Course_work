"being korean and my kids and i visit all the korean restaurants when we are out of town.  since my daughter goes to pitt we wanted to treat our daughter to korean food.  my family including my wife who is non- korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst i have ever had.  their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  will not go back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
