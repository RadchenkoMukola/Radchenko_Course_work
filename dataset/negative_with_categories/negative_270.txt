"i treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner  to recognize their high pssa scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  what can i say the kids just love this place.for me the food was terrible.  i wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. i got the cabo shrimp salad. this was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.  the kiddies had beatlejuices which is grape juice and sprit with a gummy worms. they also had oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy. each of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. the burger was juicy and delicious. i have to comment on th bathrooms. they are in terrible shape. the toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls max and erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. i couldn't believe it!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
