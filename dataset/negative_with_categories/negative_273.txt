"the service here can be hit-or-miss but more often than not i don't have problems. usually when my friend and i stop by we're waited on by the same server and our food comes up relatively quickly. it's always fresh too. unfortunately when they get busy it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared which in turn creates delays. their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. while i understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing there should always be someone to watch the counter.as a side note their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. it creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
