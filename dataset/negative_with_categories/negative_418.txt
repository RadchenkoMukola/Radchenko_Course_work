"im soo surprised with the food that we ate. im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant. especially since it is a local fav. i ordered the house made spaghetti expecting a fresh tomato base sauce. unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions. it had no...flavor!  now maybe i ruined the meal by ordering gluten free noodles....but i didnt think that would make it this bad. im soo sorry because our server was awesome and they even accommodated our big party. on a good note the bread was delicious.as much as i hate olive garden...i would preferred that.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
