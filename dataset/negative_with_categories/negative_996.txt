"we were staying at the westin and it was late and the original fish market was right on site. well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. we waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. a simple sorry for the wait would have been nice. we were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. unfortunately we did not.  the food was all bland and tasteless. oh! except for the bold taste of obay on the fries. i had blackened rainbow trout.  i expected a bold favors but yet nothing. it was not even blackened.  looked like paprika for color but that was it.  mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. we skipped dessert for obvious reasons. i am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. i hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that i could have done better myself.do yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market.  i was generous to give one star.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
