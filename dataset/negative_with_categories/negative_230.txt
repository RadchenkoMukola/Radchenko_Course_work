"the place looks like something from the godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. the food was cooked well but lackluster. i got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. on the plus the staff was very nice and very attentive. management - you really need to update the place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
