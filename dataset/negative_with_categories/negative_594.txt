"clearly based on other reviews i should try this during daylight hours. we went after a long night out landing there around 2:30. i've been to plenty of late night places after-hour bars etc but i've never been as scared as i was at jo-jo's. 2 fights broke out while we were there. first a group of guys then their girlfriends. then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. then we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. maybe this is a rare experience? anyway - i won't be heading back anytime soon!",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
