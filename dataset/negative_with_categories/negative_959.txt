"worst place ever.  i took my friend there for the first time and my son.  we waited a hour for food.  the waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  the reason they messed up the order.  we talked to the manager i'm assuming which didn't really care.  said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. never again. unprofessional and rude",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
