"we have been coming here since it opened but will not go back after our three last visits. it has gone downhill badly. three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for 30 minutes. there was a waitress but apparently she was new and only had the front half. i finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comp'ed our meals. the lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warm.two visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit service was poor and food was fair.the last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out! very poor service and food. the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely. the server past our table many times but she flew by each time like we were not there. the zucchini appetizer was good. we only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter. no ranch dressing...really! this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud. the food was very poor. the spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce. the fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce as well. my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay. we will not be going back. olive garden and bravos in the north hills will be getting our business from now on.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
