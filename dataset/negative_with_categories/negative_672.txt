"frequently get take out from this place. food usually fairly decent. except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. considering the money we have spent there over the years i was highly upset. but they seemed to care less. guess i have to drive to sesame next time.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
