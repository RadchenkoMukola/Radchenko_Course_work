"this is the absolute worst steak n shake i've ever been to. the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food the food itself was just so crappily made. it was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon steak n shake is basically a glorified mcd's) our waiter comped our whole meal.if not for the compensation i would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. the bf on the other hand was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our steak n shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.i think i'm good with my steak n shake craving for a long time now...ps. the whole joint smells like major b.o.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
