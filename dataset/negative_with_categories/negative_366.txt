"i've been to the fish market many many times over the last 18 years or so. it doesn't change much. they get maximum money for average seafood (or anything else). the sushi wasn't great this last trip (last week) and didn't taste terribly fresh. the miso soup was barely average. i did like the tataki roll but it was the only saving grace of the meal. overly expensive for what you get and service can range between average and terrible. oh and the bartender that's been there for as long as i've been going is seriously crappy and i'm amazed he's lasted so long - is that a union gig?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
