"not being from the area i traveled an hour to come here from uniontown pa. i was excited! i haven't been to this dave and buster's since i was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! i went with my cousins mind you we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. so we decided to do the eat & play combo naturally. here's where it gets bad. first of all we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. then we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. her name was ashley. we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted so we quickly put our order in. next we were sitting and talking waiting we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. she said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea right. 20 mins later we get our refills. mind you our food still hasn't came yet. i see other people getting their food that had come in after us. i was frustrated. after waiting 45 mins for our food i asked to speak with a manager. one of the servers who i asked replied rudely with well he's really busy right now. i doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you. finally 15 mins later...that's one hour folks. we get our food. what do you think the next problem was? yep the food was cold. i was completely fed up at this point and told my waitress how disappointed i was especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. the manager never came to speak with me and we didn't even receive our meals for free. the only compensation we got were $10 game cards. woopty-doo. the only thing good about this place is the games but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. so in conclusion...i do not recommend the waterfront dave and busters of homestead pa. it was horrible and i will not be returning for a very long time!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
