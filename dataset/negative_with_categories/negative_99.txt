"we were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. found this place read reviews on yelp which were ok and decided to ordered two slices. hum...sorry not slices. more like two squares of cheesy bread. when we said these aren't slices the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. we obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! they also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-it also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. since i was so hungry i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate ugh. definitely never going there if we come to visit again!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
