"first off i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. sometimes that's not possible - in the future i'll avoid this one no matter what.its always a zoo the servers are not interested in what they are doing and do it poorly. food comes out of order or not at all. the managers don't care. we actually had a waitress spill the soup catch most of it in her hand and dump it back in right in front of us. then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. just go anywhere else it can't be worse!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
