"good steak if you don't get out much.  not nearly as good as the price would lead you to believe.  ruth's chris will never be a morton's or a gibson's.  while pittsburgh does not have a gibson's you should really go to morton's.  the atmosphere is alright the drinks moderately stiff and the salad was great...  but one is supposed to come here for steak. regrettably my last two trips (i wasn't paying... hence why i went back) gave me a piece of beef like my late grandma would cook in her oven's broiler with butter.  for a $50 strip i would expect it to be more like the hand cut unfrozed meat i make for my grilling parties.  as such i would rather fire my grill up in december than give ruth's chris more money for mediocrity.good talk.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
