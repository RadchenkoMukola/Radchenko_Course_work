"there's really absolutely nothing special about max & erma's. in fact i would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. no wait ruby tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. anyways the only reason i keep coming back is because my husband's family loves to use their back room for every occasion. ugh. can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? so since we are forced to show up for family functions i've had cause to try much of the menu and most of it is average or below. the only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. if you're not getting that don't bother. i've heard about free cookie wednesday but come on is that really going to drum up that much business? at eat n' park free cookies are a staple. get it together max & erma...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
