"this review is for the taco stand in front of reyna's which is run by the same owner as reyna's and casa reyna. note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st street across the alley from pamela's.i got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. the meat was cold before i could start eating it and i assumed it had just cooled off quickly. within a few hours everything i had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. i felt sick and weak for the rest of the day and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.never going back of course. this doesn't directly reflect on casa reyna's inside restaurant but since the same people run it it makes me worry about their food handling standards.i'll probably keep getting reyna's big bag of chips when i need them for a party but i'm never eating any other prepared food from them again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
