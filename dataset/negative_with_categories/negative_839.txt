"stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  greeted by a friendly hostess seated and ignored.   after 25 minutes without a server i left.  will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  i don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  extremely dissatisfied.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
