"i feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time i go that's exactly how i feel when i leave. atria's is one of those places that i've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.i can't say the food is bad but it's not really great either. i will say the service is always so. it's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. on the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. so if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.honestly though. you are better off eating the park. i mean who doesn't love manny's bbq?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
