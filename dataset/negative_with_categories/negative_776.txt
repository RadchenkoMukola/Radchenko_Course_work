"i realize it's a sandwich shop and i dared to order a salad - but their menu is limited - so why put something on it if you're not going to do it right? ordered a grilled chicken salad take out. got back to the hotel and found it had a pile of tasteless cold french fries on it...so cold they never melted the shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. also no salt or ketchup was included so even if i did want to eat stone cold unseasoned fries they would suck. the balsamic dressing i ordered was replaced by (fake) raspberry vinaigrette so repulsive it required a trip all the way back  to the restaurant to get the correct dressing which they were out of. would have been nice to have been asked since they did have italian on hand - seems like a closer match. the iceberg lettuce olive and tomato salad oh yeah it did have a bit of chicken on it too was okay once i scraped all that orange congealed cheese off.  that and all the smokers hanging around the place (and pittsburgh in general) i would say this place is a totally over-rated dump.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
