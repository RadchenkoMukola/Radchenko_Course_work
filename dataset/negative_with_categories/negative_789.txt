"my husband and i are cubs fans and flew into pittsburgh to see friday and saturday's cubs-pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  we got to pnc park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  we stopped first at atria's.  although there was only one other table occupied outside we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people who were eating food needed it.  this was ridiculous  to us so we left!  we were paying guests just like their other guests!!  anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at dominic's.  we went to dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 and did up getting food.  atria's better rethink how they treat guests....",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
