"came in late night during light the night just for for drinks and a snack. service was fast but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing. the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot. i was excited about the crab bisque but they must have been running low and it must have been half sherry because it tasted like i was taking a shot of cheap white wine with every bite. hope the dinner fare is better.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
