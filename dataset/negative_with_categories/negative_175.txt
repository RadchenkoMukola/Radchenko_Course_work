"i was meeting up with 3 other people there. but i was a few minutes late.  because i wasn't there at the time  they refused to seat the others.  not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered.  so they left to go to some place that would serve them (dominic's)  this place clearly couldn't be bothered to have our business  which seems like an odd way to run an organization.  one star because we didn't get anything that we wanted.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
