"came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  there were 4 of us and i don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled it was a slow weeknight as well.  so yes that could have just been bad luck with the waitress but food is sub-par and atmosphere is well.i suppose this is a good dining option in some situations but there are so many other places in the area and i guess this was just nothing to write home about for me.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
