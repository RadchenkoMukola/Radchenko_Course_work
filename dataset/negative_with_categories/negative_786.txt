"i love the location and i keep trying to give redfin blues a chance but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.  the setting is fabulous there's a bike trail that runs right through the middle of the restaurant and you can sit right along the river and feel like you are in some exotic location.  i still enjoy eating here on occasion but i always keep my expectations low about the food and service.  maybe one day that will change.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
