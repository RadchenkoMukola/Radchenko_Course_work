"this is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now i remember why. the food is fair at best for the main meal. the salad is good but small. the hummus is a little bland. the best parts were the homemade wine both white and red kinda like adult kool-aid  and the jackie o cake was great. my issue was the price $59. for dinner for 2. for this price i would have expected more.i can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that i have read on this site. it's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. i will never go back here again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
