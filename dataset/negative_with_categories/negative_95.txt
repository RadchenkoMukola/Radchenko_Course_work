"guy's jumbot plate o'crap - made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the dor-stop.we both made the same order guy's jumbot. when the order arrived mine was over cooked  the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton. my serving was served without cheese. my son's was fine. when i went to pay and said something i got a vacant stare and i am so sorry. i ended up with a take out for my dog to eat. teh toast was perfect though. i started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago. we would come out about every 4-6 weeks. the last two trips the quality has started to slip a little...but never to this extent that it really mattered.save yourself the effort ....this is not a diner this is not a drive-in...this does not even rank high enough to be a dive. denny's would be a better choice.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
