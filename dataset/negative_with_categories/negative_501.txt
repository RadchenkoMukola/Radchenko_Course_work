"this was my second visit and alas my last. our first visit was at lunch and it was just ok. we weren't blown away nor were we impressed. but i will always opt to support a local mom & pop shop if all things are equal. this last visit was the pits.it was 5:30pm on a saturday night. we were one of two tables. this is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) appetizer was edamame. it was overcooked and left uneaten. i am not the adventurous sushi order-er; i had california rolls and spicy tuna. the tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. as for my ca rolls the avocado was all brown! not just the parts on the top (because i checked!) all the way through. when i brought it to the staff's attention her response was oh yea. avocado is like banana. they get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday. what?!? they did bring me another batch (that was part brown part green) but it was too late. this was my first sushi restaurant ever that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. since we were all still hungry my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. yuck! filthy. not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. when i set it back is when i noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. needless to say we skipped dessert. our first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
