"my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving. the inside is super dingy deli/convenience store so i was excited for a real down and dirty deli sandwich. they have a lot of weird items in their grocery section which can be kind of fun to look through.i got an italian hoagie as i feel is the appropriate term for this ultra-pittsburgh spot. it was bad. totally skimpy on the meat and it had american cheese and mayo which don't go well with italian meats at all...provolone and oil & vinegar would have made way more sense. the bread was a squishy white bun. i mean i still ate it but i didn't really enjoy it. it made me kind of sad. it was just a sad floppy excuse for a sandwich. at least it was cheap?maybe i should have gotten the chipped ham instead since that's what they are famous for. i also suspect the location in the north hills has to be at least marginally better...this isaly's is clearly past its prime.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
