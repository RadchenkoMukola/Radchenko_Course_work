"what a disappointment. when the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us we should have known it would be that kind of evening. worst part of the meal was the pasta trio--the limpest pastiest most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta i have ever been served. one waiter saved the day by insisting i reorder while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew. every aspect of the experience was substandard although when i reordered the beet salad was very good. overall lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
