"i know tom's is a south hills staple but other than the convenience of it being open 24 hours a day i'm not impressed. even by greasy spoon standards this isn't great. the wait staff is hit and miss. some are friendly and attentive (there's an awesome greek lady there that i love) but just as often drinks sit unrefreshed for an entire meal and i can't get anyone's attention to prepare the check. the food is really bland (hard to make a boring grilled cheese but they manage it) and priced pretty high for what it is. i've been there five or six times in an effort to find a reliably good menu item but i've given up. it's just bad.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
