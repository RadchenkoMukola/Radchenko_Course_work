"minimalist happy hour.  bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that's what we wanted to do. chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  prices too high for strip district beer.  smelly.  upstairs looks like it's a club at night.  rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  good for a quick beer and that's about it.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
