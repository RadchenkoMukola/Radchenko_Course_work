"microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer i would have drank otherwise.  one waitress i had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as kind of like coors light.  if i wanted coors i'll pay half as much and have one.  the food is actually a saving grace as it was pretty good.  head next door to sing sing for drinks though.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
