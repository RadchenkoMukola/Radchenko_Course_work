"horrible food don't waste your moneythis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i've ever had i haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. i looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
