"my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh pa.  i was not impressed with my sandwich there.  i've only been once so maybe i ordered the wrong thing but it just wasn't blowing my skirt up.i ordered the corned beef sandwich with the fries and slaw and it tasted a little bland to me.  it needed some sauce.  i think with some mustard this might have been great.  it was dry.  i did enjoy the cole slaw.the service was fast and the server we had was very friendly and attentive.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
