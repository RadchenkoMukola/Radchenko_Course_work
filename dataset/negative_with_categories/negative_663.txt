"prime time location and they know it.yet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  the place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  i have always steered clear of roland's because of an assumption.  but....the wife and her friend wanted a lobster roll so i was roped into going.  i opted to just drink a draught.  they got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  the sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  it also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  the roll itself was lobster but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  there was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....pathetic.service was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.go to wholey!!!!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
