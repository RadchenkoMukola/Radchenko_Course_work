"in all fairness i went to this place after stuffing myself at vincent's pizza park.  still i know a good pizza when i see one and this place is totally passable but great or even good it is not.  my friend and i were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  still it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  we walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a pizza perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.  in the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza pushed out the door only to walk across the street eat mediocre pizza and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
