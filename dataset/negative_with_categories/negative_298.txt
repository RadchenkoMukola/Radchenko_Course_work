"aaahhh.  why do i have such a discordance with pittsburgh yelpers' opinions of sushi places?  this place is not 4 stars.  the long line -- one person andy making the sushi makes you think it's a gem in the strip district.  eh.with andy's special there was a variety of rolls and made with a continuous strip of seawood (ie inside on one roll outside on the next) which i actually found annoying as the rolls fell apart when trying to separate them.  there just wasn't any flavor -- so i laid on the soy sauce and wasabi but to no avail.i'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
