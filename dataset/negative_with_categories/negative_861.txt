"this is a one time visit. the worst service ever. it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. the food was mediocre at best. the bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. not even shaved cheese nothing. total waste of money. the lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality and that might insult some great diners.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
