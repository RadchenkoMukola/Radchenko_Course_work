"the only good thing this restaurant has going for it is their bar! they have 22oz glasses!!!  and is very close to my job which is great for an after work drink the food is terrible i mean the worse of the worse i am not a big fan of italian food and it's because of restaurants like this!! on one occasion i made the mistake of ordering food from this restaurant i had tortellini  in a tomato sauce  i've had better italian food from a can.more is not always better the serving size could easily have fed six grown adults.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
