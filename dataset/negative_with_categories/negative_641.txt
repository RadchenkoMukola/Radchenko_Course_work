"we were in pittsburgh for one night and olive or twist was near our hotel.  there were many other restaurants but this place looked nice.  the atmosphere was nice and if i was rating only for atmosphere i'd give it 4 stars.  however i'm mainly rating their food and service.  we were greeted promptly but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  i ordered the traditional french dip sandwich and fries.  i enjoy a good french dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst i've ever eaten. in fact i couldn't finish it.  the meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  it wasn't soggy from the au jus but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  overall if i was going back to pittsburgh in this area i would stay far away from olive or twist.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
