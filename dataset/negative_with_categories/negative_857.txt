"do not go here! they are understaffed incompetent  and slow. it was like getting waited on by 1st job people. the place smells like bleach. it's tacky too hot. they play pop music and it's supposed to be an italian place. not one person there ever smiled and i was treated like a body in a chair not a person wanting to enjoy a meal. very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals. i suggest eating out of a seafood dumpster if you plan on going here.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
