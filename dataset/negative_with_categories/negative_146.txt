"another place that i visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as i remember it.  and the place never lets me down; it's just as bad as i remember.  the seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  the staff is rude.  the prices are too high for the quality.  just all around disappointing.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
