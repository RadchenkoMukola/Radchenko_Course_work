"i've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  tonight was my second attempt here.   first time new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes at 15 i walked.  not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   tonight the waiter seemed mad that i didn't know what i wanted to order.  after i explained that i'd never been there he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  i walked again.  no more tries here.  maybe i'm doing something wrong?  haha.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
