"well it started well. food was okay. deep dish pizza was good. but the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!we were greeted and seated well. but later the service was not all good. bad bad service. first of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. the server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. she just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).later when we talked about this in the front the girl there also just listened and said okay not even a sorry once!!!i would not like to go there again... :(",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
