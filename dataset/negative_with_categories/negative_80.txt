"when i told people i was going to pittsburgh everyone recommended primanti bros. i went and was underwhelmed. it was a big sandwich but the flavour was not amazing. i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. as a chicago native i feel it's the equivalent of people recommending giordano's or portillo's. they're not exactly the greatest places in town but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. do it just to say you did.i don't like coleslaw.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
