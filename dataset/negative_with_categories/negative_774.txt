"we just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we'd try them out. their prices are great but seriously worst customer service i've ever seen. i walked in and the guy had to finish his cell phone game before helping me. i get home and realize we were given the wrong pizza. when i called to see if they had our correct one the guy tells me that's what we ordered. i assured him we didn't i was there when my girlfriend called the order in. he just said sorry man and didn't offer any solutions. so we just picked off the garbage toppings that we didn't order and threw most of it away. it would've taken very little effort to fix it for us. all this after it took them an hour to make the thing. i'd go back if i were desperate but it's seriously amateur hour.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
