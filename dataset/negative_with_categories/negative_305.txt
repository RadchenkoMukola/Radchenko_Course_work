"i think this should be more like 1.5 stars. i got a 6-pack of tamales. they were more expensive than i would've guessed (i sort of had to considering they weren't priced). first i open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales in fact contains only five! the filling is fine but the masa blows. it is dry and gritty. the preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? really?). i'm saving the remaining ones for when i'm too drunk to care about anything. the tortillas are still worth it.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
