"the words epic fail get thrown around a lot these days....but i really feel like they apply in this situation.we went on friday april 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  it was busy but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.the food (just appetizers mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  we placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*by 7:00 we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  we just wanted to leave.instead of comping anything they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  uhhhh yeah.  thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   we finally were able to leave around 7:30.bar louie:  you are dead to me.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
