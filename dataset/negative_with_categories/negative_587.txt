"the hot and sour soup was ok. everything else was basically inedible. water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. more than 1/4 of the buffet was american food and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be krab considering the price of the buffet. no pot-stickers no pork egg rolls no spareribs no won-ton soup.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
