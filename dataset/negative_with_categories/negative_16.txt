"i made it back here about two weeks ago.  i must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of july.  whether or not it was an off night i do not know but the place was loud and crowded the service was bad and the food was mediocre at best.  i should have just waited it out at point brugge.  i won't becoming back anytime soon.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
