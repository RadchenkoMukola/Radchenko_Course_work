"i always see this place and saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. the atmosphere was pleasant. my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he loved. i however ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. it was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. i'm not one to send back food and that's my fault but the waitress came by once as i was eating over heard me upset about my food looked at me then continued on her way. needless to say i don't think i will be returning.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
