"why come to this place when you have a tasty world of italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!the place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a fun looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? apparently it is to some.)don't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. but it certainly is sub-par. my chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. the service was mediocre.keep driving to bloomfield!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
