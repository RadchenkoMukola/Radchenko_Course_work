"so four of us came in for the first time.diner 1 - ordered the lobster roll sandwich.  lobster on a roll nothing more...that's it.  nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this.  a bland poor excuse of a sandwich that does a disservice to all northeasterners who know what a lobster roll is and this ain't it.  is this lobster?  read on.diner 2 - ordered a large raw bar sampler which was six quahog clams six oysters and six rubbery shrimp.  who serves tough chewy quahogs on a raw bar?  this dive.  also ordered the mussels which were not seasoned and swimming in water.  no wine/garlic sauce as advertised on the menu - water.    bland and awful.  finished with the mediterranean pizza which is spinach feta and olives - the better part of the dinner.diner 3 - steamed clams.  again who serves quahogs for steamed clams?  these amateurs.  also had the clam chowder - which appropriately had minced quahogs in it. diner 4 - ordered the salad with the lobster roll hold the bread.  also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it.  lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color.  why the need to put lobster in a dye?   because...it's not maine lobster!  imposter fish is dyed and artificially flavored then frozen then thawed then microwaved at roland's and called lobster.  that's my guess.sent the mussels back.  no offer to reduce the check or offer a comped dessert.   rest rooms are dirty and smell of urine.  men's was an awful smelling pit and i was told that the ladies had one toilet drenched with urine on the seat another blocked up and overflowing and a third that could be used.this place is a smelly dingy dive bar with horrible food and poor service.  it is a trap for the unsuspecting tourist. you have been warned...stay away!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
