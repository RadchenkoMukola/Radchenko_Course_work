"i went here on a recent business trip and there aren't many decent options in west homestead so i decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   i was highly disappointed in the service and i only ordered take out.    upon going to the bar to announce that i was there for take out there were 3 other people at the bar.   the bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    after announcing the reason for my visit she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  no offer of water or a drink.  another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink she stated to him my order would be right up.   he then asked if she offered me a water to which she replied her order is going to be right up.    he placed a glass of water in front of me.then i hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .it's takeout  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.gentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)after more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  she then rings me up.   i don't expect take out to be piping hot but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.when i go to eat my meal utensils were not included.  i now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. very disappointing experience.   will not be returning.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
