"we went here with sixteen people. the only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. the service was pretty good to considering the large party. my wife and i got the sicilian sampler appetizer and the ultimate feast for two as our dinner entree. the calamari was uneatable and the ravioli was just down right nasty. the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had. the meat balls had absolute no taste kind of like cardboard. the pork sausage tasted burnt. the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta. the lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce you had to search for any meat or cheese. our garlic bread came out literally black. i can't even believe somebody would serve that. we will not be back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
