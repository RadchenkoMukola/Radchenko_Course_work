"super disappointed in this place. came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. all i ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later and ten minutes prior to painting i still had not received mine. on top of that there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. when we told him i'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. when the food arrived it was mediocre at best. will not be coming back to this place unless i'm dragged.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
