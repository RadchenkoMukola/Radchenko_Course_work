"my girlfriend really hyped this place up but i ended up spending $110 on a terrible meal i couldn't even eat. i ordered the chicken marsala (waitress's favorite) and it was disgusting. the sauce was very over powering and it was drenched in it. if that wasn't bad enough the chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it. i ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price. won't be going back here...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
