"not a pleasant experience.  while looking at the menu we ordered a margarita and a draft beer.  the beer came in a bottle instead of a draft and the margarita had a terrible funky taste - almost a plastic chemical taste.  next we chose to have chips and dips/salsa.  we were able to choose three dips/salsas and the server brought one that was incorrect.  to his credit he promptly corrected the error and brought the right one.needless to say we elected not to have dinner and departed after drinks and chips.  there is much better mexican food and drink in the 'burgh.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
