"for what it's worth dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. people are fanatical about this place and its food. is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? from my perspective i detest their service the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. also the food was unpalatable. i order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. i was too full and their portion is huge so i left two pieces of pancakes. the waitress don't even bother to ask me if i need a box to take it home or if everything is good. although she did refilled my coffee once i barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.i think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when i tipped her. i should have known i just feel like they treated me differently that's all. this review is based on my dinning experience and the service. seriously if they mean business they should improve. especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. do i want to come back? never ever.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
