"normally one would think one chain restaurant is just like the rest but i have had nothing but problems here. the staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. i've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; i ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though i've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
