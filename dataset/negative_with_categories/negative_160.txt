"i am not being hyperbolic when i say that my last experience here was the worst food experience i have ever had. i have eaten at bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. so when my roomate wanted to go there i was pretty excited. there were 4 of us. two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. my burger was delicious. it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. while my food was really good there were some issues with the other items ordered. two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. unfortunately the hair did not stop there. another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. we decided that we should let our waitress know. i stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. the waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). on top of this she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it leaving the sullied food on the table. when she came back i told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. at this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered we didn't feel like that was asking too much. luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. i will never eat at bado's again. a good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. i have been places where there have been food issues before and i have also worked in a restaurant. i completely understand that mistakes happen. however the reaction that we received was unacceptable.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
