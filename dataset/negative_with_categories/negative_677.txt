"there's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place but the food was average at best.  we were there on a pens playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  our orders were somewhat mixed up.  the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  i tasted a slice of pizza which is definitely the best thing they offer.  the crust was delicious and homemade.  if you are going to order something i would go with the pizza.  we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good also.  if you are looking for good food homestead better choices at blue dust or tin front.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
