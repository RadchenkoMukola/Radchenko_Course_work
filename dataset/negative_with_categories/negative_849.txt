"i was really looking forward to lidia's.  and was really disappointed.  bread was good. the cocktails were good.  the service was attentive and friendly (just don't get between a server dishing out the unlimited pasta and a hungry customer who clearly hadn't reached their limit with the unlimited servings).  too bad the food wasn't good.  the beet salad was underwhelming.  i had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  i felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  i suspect such positive memories are no longer :(my other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  another disappointment.   and thus my rating of meh. which is a huge shame.  but life goes on...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
