"the location is nice with plenty of outdoor seating on the river. the food is not that great.  they have an all you can eat crab leg dinner.  my husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked.  i had a crab cake sandwich in which i could not really taste the crab.  prices:  sandwiches ~$10 entrees ~$18 crab legs $25.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
