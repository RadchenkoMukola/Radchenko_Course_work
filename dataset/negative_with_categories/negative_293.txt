"meh i've experienced better is an understatement.friday's is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh...1.  when we were seated it was quick which was a surprise.  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why.  i was happy about that.2.  i ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact.  it was a nice size however at $6.00/pop that was half of my food bill.3.  the waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone.  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha!4.  food came.  my burger had lettuce on it only.  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  i had to wait to ask for my pickle.5.  the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting.  disappointment.6.  the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  never again will i eat at friday's.  i will however go should a happy hour arise...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
