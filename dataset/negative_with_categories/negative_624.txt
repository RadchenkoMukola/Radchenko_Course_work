"i don't care for primanti brothers.  it is overrated.  there are much better sandwiches in the city.the sandwiches aren't bad they just aren't great.  i like the fries.  i like the vinegar based cole slaw.  both are great.  the white bread is fine.  my issue is with the main ingredients.  the main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality.my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy.  i've been to 4 different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy.better pittsburgh sandwich alternatives:fathead's has a sandwich with kielbasa and pierogies.wingharts has a burger with fries and cole slaw.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
