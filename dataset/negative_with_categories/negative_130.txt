"get me some peanutzz!! we decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was $3. this didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but i feel like the place could use the money. peanutz is a small venue. the bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the dj is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. if you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the dj or at you... maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. i thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. beers were so cheap - i think we paid $5 for three draft beers. woot!! however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. i won't be returning even if peanutz offered some peanuts.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
