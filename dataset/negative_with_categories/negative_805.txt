"i tried the cold cheese and toppings slice that beto's is famous for.  if you have heard about there style of serving pizza and are wondering what the punch line is there isn't one.   they make a big square tomato-sauce pizza and throw cold shredded cheese and other cold toppings on it and that's it. there's no secret ingredient or special something  that makes it tastes like anything other than what you would get it you grabbed pizza fixings from your kitchen and forgot to bake them.   i guess a lot of people like it and more power too them. but i don't get it. ramblin' boy didn't get it. i see zero reason to agree with people that say that this is the best pizza in the region.  maybe their hoagies will be better.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
