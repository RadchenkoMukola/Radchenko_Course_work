"three strikes and you're out!  we had brunch there a few months back and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  that meal was comped and i figured it was an off day.  we went back about a month later for dinner and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  we were willing to try again so we went for dinner tonight.  i ordered the filet and it was like eating a salt shaker.  i was shocked that for a third time i had a piss poor meal at casbah.  i sent that back and ordered the sea bass.  when i got to the end of the piece of fish it was raw.  needless to say i will never return to this restaurant.  looking back what should i have expected from the sister restaurant of mad mex?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
