"my first time going to barb's country junction and i really wanted to like this place i really did...however i didn't.the food was decent some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. i got pancakes bacon and eggs. the pancakes were really good and fluffy the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. my son had a burger and it was good. the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. i would give the food 3/5.the service was subpar for sure. while our waitress was a really nice girl she wasn't on top of anything at all. had to ask for coffee refills had to ask for silverware for napkins...etc. she got the order messed up and so on. i give the service 2/5.the inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. it also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. a customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. i give the interior 2/5.the prices were decent. i fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. i give the prices 3/5.so in summary you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. there are better diners in the area that i will patronize in the future rather than barb's.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
