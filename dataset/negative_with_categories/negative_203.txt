"you can't screw up pasta--it would be very hard.  only buca di beppo has managed to do that and they did it by drowning the pasta in salt and charging through the nose for it.the food here is pretty darn good.  i love the bread they bring to your table and the atmosphere is very fun.my problem is that the past four times i've been here the service was awful.  tonight our waiter brought our bread and salads before our drinks and this was only a huge problem bc i was dying of thirst.  our waiter (vincent) had 3 tables.  it was like he was trained not to bring our table anything unless hte other two tables needed something.  he would disappear for 20 minutes at a time (i'm not kidding).  i gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order.  he came out with entrees for the one table salads for the other and bread for our table.  why would you not just get our drinks?  you can come back to the table multiple times!!!this has happened the past four times i dined here and i'm just over the awful service.  too bad i won't be back bc i wanted to love this restaurant.good food awful service.  2 stars bc i love carbs so damn much.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
