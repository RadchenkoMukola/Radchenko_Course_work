"obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  a lot of bottles.  decent tap selection though you are guaranteed to have a rather lopsided selection among the taps.food is fair; i've yet to go there with others and have our whole meal come out at once.  salad will come first then a couple of dogs then fries.  if you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served well let's just say that no one ever taught the manager cooks or servers here that lesson.now their service:  really lackluster.  entitled is the word i would use.  it pains me to give them 15% because honestly they don't earn it even when i was a regular and knew some of them by name. meh.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
