"another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.so we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server michael. she was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. michael our server finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. he does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. the manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. he informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. he goes away. i cut into my steak and it's you guessed it pittsburgh rare. i asked for medium rare. he returns and i tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. the manager apologizes again and asks me if i want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. i said no thanks. he comped my husband's meal and we left. i never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! i will never go back to this applebee's again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
