"the location is convenient but i was not a fan of the food. i had shrimp and chinese veggies and crab rangoon. they cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. i won't go back for food but the crab rangoon was ok. they didn't give any sauce. you have to ask for it. that sucks.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
