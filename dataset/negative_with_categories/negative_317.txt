"rock bottom is a chain brew pub one that in my opinion is just ok.  the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. they have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. their food is pretty much like their beers forgettable. i have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.i feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but i would probably describe them as the chili's of brew pubs. if you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite or at least until the burgatory opens!",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
