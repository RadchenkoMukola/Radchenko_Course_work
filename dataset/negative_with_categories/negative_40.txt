"good food great service but high prices.my date and i shared 2 appetizers a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. the bruschetta with fig and grape butter prosciutto and blue cheese was good so was the beet salad.we were disappointed with our entrees. my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. my date had the salmon with potato fennel puree which she said tasted fishy.make sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.although i would come here again there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. i would rank casbah below eleven within the big burrito group of restaurants.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
