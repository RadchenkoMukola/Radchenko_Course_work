"a few friends from out of town wanted to meet at sushi kim for dinner so i agreed. the sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes while their kids liked the miso soup and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). i'm not a fan of japanese food so i stuck with the korean selections after all i was in a korean restaurant! i had mandu guk which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings and broth. my daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked but we've had better. the pork was really greasy and not cooked on a fire grill no char marks equals less than tasty meat. sushi kim alternates between a hit or a miss. sometimes you get a few different panchan (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables) and sometimes you only get kimchi wth? if you judge a place by it's patrons i've seen few koreans eat here so that sums up the authenticity factor. nice big restaurant just lacking in overall experience.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
