"the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. i had a bus to catch so i couldn't wait around waiting for the check so i went to the counter to pay. she never brought my check never checked to see if my drink needed refilled she just mopped the floors. the burger was really greasy the fries were luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. as a new pittsburgher i'm not impressed.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
