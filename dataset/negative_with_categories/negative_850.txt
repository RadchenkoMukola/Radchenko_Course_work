"this place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  i've had pretty good experiences inside it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  it's the rare place i can get a frisco melt well the only place i can get a frisco melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk walk in or drive thru.just take a gun on weekends you'll be fine.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
