"absolutely awful service.  went to papa j's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly rude and unhelpful..  decided to try it again since it is close to stage 62.  big mistake.  greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  at one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  he said 'what do you want me to do about it? and said they had a busy night.  this is when tables around us sat empty. i then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  the bill was prepared incorrectly. if you want average food and terrible service this is your place.  we will never go back.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
