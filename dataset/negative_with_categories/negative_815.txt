"this was my second time eating at roland's  seafood grill the first time i had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. it took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks i asked for a cup of water i didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce i will never visit this place again!!! it wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. i spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him i just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that i had tonight again.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
