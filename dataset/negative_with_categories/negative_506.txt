"i was pretty disappointed with this place. i thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. i went here around 12am on a friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. i ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. there are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. the people working there are really nice though which is a plus. overall i wouldn't go back.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
