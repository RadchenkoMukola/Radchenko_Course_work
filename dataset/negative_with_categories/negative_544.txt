"what a disappointment!! evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  we had reservations for 5 people at 7pm this past saturday. two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. she was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. when the rest of our group arrived (on time!!) i informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  she told me it would be awhile. huh? when asked what awhile was she said 20min.  but then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which i take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).food was a let down. potato latkes were greasy and blah.  fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  others had the same sentiments.service was rough.  long waits and lack of attentiveness. noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.not sure pino's will get a repeat visit.  disappointment:(",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
