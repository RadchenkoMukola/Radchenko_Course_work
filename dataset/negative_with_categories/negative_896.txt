"the food is good and the portions are large.  the service is terrible.  the servers are just too cool to show any sort of hospitality.  no personality or spark.  i don't know if they hate working there or hate serving people.  it's puzzling.  why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude?  i have been here a couple of times and it doesn't change.  they just look at you blankly like they don't understand what you are saying.  i've never had a staring contest with a hostess before.  it's bizarre.  i wonder if they are all on xanax...",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
