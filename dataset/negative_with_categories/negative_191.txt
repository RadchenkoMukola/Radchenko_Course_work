"i've tried to give this mcdonalds a chance but my patience has run out. the only reason why i came here as much as i did is because i like the $1 iced coffees. but it's not even worth it. this mcdonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. whenever i want to go through the drive-thru i can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. and even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. so most of the time i just park and go inside the restaurant. today was a horrible day. i ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. it only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. i waited 10 minutes!! sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! it's not like i ordered a meal! during that time i saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! wth?! i told the petite sleepy eyed cashier i wanted my money back! her eyes opened wide in surprise like i really woke her up or something. she saidyoure the one who ordered the iced coffee? i can get it for you! for real? she was the one who took my order! i told her i waited too long and i just want my money back. the manager offered to make my iced coffee but  i refused because i had just had enough.there are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. there is no organization or teamwork everyone is scrabbling. it looks like none of them want to be there. i used to work in fast food and i know it sucks but come on!i'm sorry but i can't recommend this mcdonalds. it's poo. i'm not coming back here anymore. guess i'll be going to starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
