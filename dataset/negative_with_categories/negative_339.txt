"for the record i have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. i will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! we went during happy hour last week and i had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam bitters and lemon sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. no fig flavor to be detected. to make matters worse when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony she responded with a yes it's got lemon in it. when he pressed the issue she simply repeated yes it's a lemon and fig drink. more frustrating than conversations with the wall. the risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be but this was proposed as an entree...). it had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. we added lots of salt and pepper. total waste of $25 bucks. also their bar seating sucks. the chairs are stationary and far away from each other and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
