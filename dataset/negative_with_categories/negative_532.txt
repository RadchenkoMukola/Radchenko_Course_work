"my boyfriend & i went to alla famiglia for our (late) valentine's day dinner last night. we don't go out & splurge like this often so we were really excited for a special dinner. the food was out of this world (bread & sides salad pasta alla vodka and veal chop milanese) but the service was absolute garbage. i've seriously been treated better at a tgifriday's. we waited pretty much unattended to at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. once seated i practically had to beg for a wine list. we called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. the cab was taking forever so we called a different company. as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company a waitress walked by. we heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff ugh those people at the bar are just now ordering a cab. it was 10:30. on a saturday night.i don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s) but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else they would've treated us like adults.when i plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around i expect to be treated like i'm spending $160 at your restaurant. despite how great the food was i won't be returning. so disappointed.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
