"yes i know.  i'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.but let me explain.  my friends and i wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  i haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in pittsburgh so i expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  however from the get go our host was absolutely terrible.  he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  there was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to look in the back to see if there was room.  one of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  our first host came back reiterated the same thing the server told us but never gave us menus.  i had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.to be fair our assigned server was very nice.  she was friendly and approachable.  but of course our food came and mine was cold.  the potatoes in the hash i ordered was stale old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  also our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  i know i may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  not to be completely biased the rest my party had decent food.  it just wasn't anything special.  definitely not worth $12 for brunch.needless to say i will not be coming back to this place.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
