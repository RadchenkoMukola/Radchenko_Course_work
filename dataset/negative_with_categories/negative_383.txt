"i walked in expecting a great experience. it has a great atmosphere. there was nothing wrong with our service but the food was overpriced and pretty meh. i had the tiramisu which is one of my favorites to get and it was horrible. it tasted like it came out of a walmart freezer on clearance. won't be coming back anytime soon.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
