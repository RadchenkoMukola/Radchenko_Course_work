"warning  this place is for suckers only ..... funky smelling worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchyun-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. as p.t. barnum once said  '' there's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better .",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
