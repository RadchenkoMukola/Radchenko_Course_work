"wow. what a shame. my family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. we are a very large family and love foods of all kind. we've eaten chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. hands down this was the worst we've ever had. cold tough congealed and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. i'll never order from here again. quite frankly the fact that i took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. my complaints fell on deaf ears. i guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. i understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. it happens. but when it does you bend over backwards to make it right. not at this place. i was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. i guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  too bad. because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. this family of 7 won't be visiting china sea ever again. oh and by the way why can't i give this place zero stars?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
