"ooooppss...update time.   got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   so i'm on my dinner break sitting chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  i see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  wtf is that!  omg it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  i threw the fork down and my co worker says... you're seeing stuff.  um not!  i sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  thirty minutes later  shazam...found it. ugh my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  eeekkkk it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  fuck!  call the manager at co-op and he says...bring it in for a refund thanks for being so nice about it...we usually just see worms in the fruits.  geez thanks for that lil tidbit.    this happened last week around the sept 14 2010.  guess that means it's really organic huh?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
