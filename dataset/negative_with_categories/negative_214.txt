"ugh i hate this place.  people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like.  the food is overpriced.  the service is snotty and slow.  i can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  the food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  they're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead you're made to wait and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  you can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  try soho or finnegan's instead.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
