"meh. i always hope for the best. i did not however get the best. although i would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. but i really don't think there's much you can mess up. the buffalo pierogies however was a total miss. i do not want to make any accusations but they did not seem to be freshly made maybe frozen pre-made ones. and they were covered in hot sauce. it didn't look appetizing nor did it actually taste appetizing. they have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. but all the special drinks were mixed and i knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. i went with a glass of malbec which was a good choice. actually it was the best choice there. maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
