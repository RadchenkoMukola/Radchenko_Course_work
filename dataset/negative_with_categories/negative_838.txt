"they have inaccurate hours posted. i tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. when i told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said oh that's ok.... and hung up on me. i will never be ordering from them again which is a shame since they are so close to me. i immediately called pizza parma which gladly delivered to me. i recommend ordering from pizza parma since they have similar menu items they post accurate hours and they don't hang up on you! seriously? why answer the phone?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
