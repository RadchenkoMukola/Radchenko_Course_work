"people really are nuts about their pizza in the 'burgh - this i'm learning. i ordered a pizza from here because it's in my hood (walking distance even) and because someone told me it's been their favorite pizza since they were wee little. i think a lot of places in pit have false-yum status because people are just emotionally attached to things they've eaten for so many years... i don't fault them for that but this just isn't great pizza in my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
