"a little pricy for food but not too bad. sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day. when they put the boats in the water it's a little noisy but entertaining. i had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland. iced tea was good. this is not the place to come to have a good meal but a nice view and a breeze then it's ok. next time i think i will just get drinks and an appetizer and enjoy the view.other people i see complained about the service but our waitress was really good and took care of us without hovering.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
