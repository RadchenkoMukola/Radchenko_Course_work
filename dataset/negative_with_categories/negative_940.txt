"here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-i and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. my friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. the restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party just one hour before lunch told that they did not get the paneer/cheese. they can substitute it for malai kofta. it was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / paneer entree. on the other hand the malai kofta was just potato in the gravy. the quality of food in this party was awfully bad. this is a humble request to all indian americans and all non-indian americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. we are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. you can confirm these details with me anytime i am engineer by profession. i was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but i am lucky to get an experience before hand. i will never never recommend this place ever.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
