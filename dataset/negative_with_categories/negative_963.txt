"usually i really like this place.  stopped in after not eating all day and ordered the famous lobster roll.  it took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick mancino toast.  thats it!  oh and less than stellar fries with a cup of cole slaw.  i waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...i guess you can't get it right every time.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
