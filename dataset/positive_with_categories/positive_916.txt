"great food! the meal starts off with their corn bread (not like the corn bread you get in the south) which is delicious. we've gotten a variety of entrees including a delicious salmon dish a quail special and the lamb burger all of which were delicious. the restaurant is byob which makes up for the entree cost. i highly recommend a great meal in a small unassuming location.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
