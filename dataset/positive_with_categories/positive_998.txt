"marges is tucked away in the delightful pittsburgh neighborhood of mckees rocks. this place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's and half my grandmas kitchen.the seating room is accommodation the service prompt and courteous.the prices are fantastic and so is the food.i had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage potatoes eggs and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. it was excellent. ladies and gents i can put food away  like a champ and i still had leftovers.my friend had a succulent buttery french toast. simple but they nailed it.i would return.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
