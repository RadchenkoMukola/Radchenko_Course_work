"went here for the brunch prix-fixe menu- such a good deal! drink appetizer and main course all for $24. first we got a pastry basket with mini-scones croissants and biscuits. i told myself i would eat half of each to try everything but they were too tasty to resist! for appetizer i got the granola and berries and my friend got the creamy polenta. both were great options! the granola did not taste like anything you get in a box- could definitely tell it was made in-house. the creamy polenta was so different and delicious- will get that next time i go back. was pretty full by this point but that didn't stop me from completing my  main course! i got the casbah benedict with smoked salmon and my friend has the tuscan eggs. we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were stuffed by the end!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
