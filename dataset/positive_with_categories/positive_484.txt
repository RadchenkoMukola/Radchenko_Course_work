"great atmosphere lots of owl decorations.  the staff are very nice and are really trendy. it looks like they are working hard. i experienced fast service even though the cafe was almost full. temperature was nice and the noise was average they have some good window tables. i would say there is a good mix of regular neighborhood locals here hipsters and intellectual types. the demographic also includes college students. it's all vegetarian or vegan yay!  the food is normally very good.  i did have one experience where in terms of how spicy i wanted my meal i replied 0 out of 10.  the food came and my dish was probably an 8 out of 10 in terms of spicy-ness.  i could barely eat it as could others at my table.  eventually i gave up trying to finish it.  i could have asked for a replacement but i chose not to but im certain they would of fixed it for me if i had.  but other than this instant i've found the food fresh and well cooked.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
