"it was a bit out of the way of where we were staying but i was swayed by the yelp reviews!  you did not steer me wrong. a nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  my wife and i both got lattes and pastries and everything was good to go.it looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there rooted to a chair.  we got the next to last free table.  almost every two-top had only one person sitting at it.  i would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. recommend!p.s. i thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
