"in order of consumption...the bar is energetic but has the worst and completely immovable bar stools ever created. we were initially placed outside in the all year round patio...absolutely no atmosphere so we asked for a table inside...20 minutes later we were inside which had a much better vibe. i started with the blue bay mussels which were truly the best i have ever had plump juicy and perfectly complemented by the chorizo and white beans absolutely sublime. my wife had the veal meatballs that were also delicious. for the entrees i had the lamb loin with couscous and my wife had the veal tortellini although very tasty we oth agreed that both were too rich. my only criticism would be that all the entrees looked rich.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
