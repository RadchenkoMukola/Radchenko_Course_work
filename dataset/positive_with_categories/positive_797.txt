"so i have not been to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurants but since i was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place i went along. first surprise: decent beer.  i remembered the normal rb brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles including a very good imperial ipa that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than i expected.  recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. i'll be back next time i'm in pittsburgh for work.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
