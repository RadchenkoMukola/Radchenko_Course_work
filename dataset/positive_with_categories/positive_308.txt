"recently dined here for the first time and can say that i was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment. the cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. the service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. the only downside to this place is the atmosphere. it can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
