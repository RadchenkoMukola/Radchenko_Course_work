"i would have to say i'm pretty partial to rock bottom i have been going almost every thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic team trivia. my friends and i love the atmosphere the dj (todd) and the service that we get at rock bottom. every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! as an avid rock bottomer hands down i have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have had here at rock bottom. whether i have eaten dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant my favorite and my food of choice is the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. it is a meal itself! the mixture of onions cheese spinach and tomatoes is perfection! another favorite of mine is the barbecue chicken pizza it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. the service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. a truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! come to team trivia every thursday at 8pm!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
