"still one of the best places to get soy capps but they no longer have an extensive tea list. what's left is not a bad selection but there are dramatically less choices so it's no longer where i would go to sample new varieties of tea. sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by u.s. foods or the like; nothing is local. it'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. until then it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso with nice vibes and pleasant service.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
