"i was pleased to finally find a place in pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. i tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing i could have made the meal better myself. not here.the food is made to order seasonal local some organic...in short they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. i had made it a point to never eat fish in a pittsburgh restaurant but casbah changed my mind. the cod dish i had was delicious--not overcooked breaded too oily or too salty! decor is subtle and great for a date. service was friendly and accommodating.  i will most definitely return!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
