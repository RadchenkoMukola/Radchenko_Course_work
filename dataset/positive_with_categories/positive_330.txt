"3.5 rounding down. its been a while since jb and i ate here and i would consider going back but we just haven't gotten around to it. the beer selection looked great but the first 3 beers that i wanted hadn't come in yet (they were in the middle of expanding their offerings this really bothers me...if you don't have the product don't put it on the menu).its not necessarily vegetarian friendly i got a pizza and it was good not fantastic only good. justin was satisfied with his meal. its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but i wouldn't recommend going out of your way.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
