"this place is so hit-or-miss for me. sometimes the food is amazing; sometimes it is terrible. example: i ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. i came back a couple weeks later and it was bland and unappetizing. maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- i don't know.the 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss too. sometimes they're great. other times i've waited for ages just for a menu. one guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. that said there are some good dishes like the black & gold. i like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. a lot of people i've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. there's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor. there's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes teas and coffee drinks and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries. and i love the magazine and book rack even though the magazines are usually two years old. still fun to read.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
