"i definitely got the best service of the restaurants on ellsworth from this restaurant and they also offer the best food for the price.  the menu is creative and dinner (soup salad and salmon) were delicious but there is nothing that portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be portugese).  in fact i think it would be considered a national security threat in portugal to have a place that serves dinner not serve wine.  the government of this state is partly to blame though.  since when did pa become goddamn utah?!  but rendell's gotta get his cut i guess...anyway the place is small and intimate one server handles the floor.  minus points for the lack of alcoholand frozen butter with the bread but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
