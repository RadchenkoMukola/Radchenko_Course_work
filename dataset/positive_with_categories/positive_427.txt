"my boyfriend and i come here every other saturday at a minimum. he gets the qhf with eggs i get the qhf tofu side of onion gravy. it's potatoes eggs or tofu cheese seisage pickled onions (the best) and this yummy aioli (let's be honest it's mayo). i wouldn't call it healthy (maybe i'll consider adding some vegetables to switch it up) but it's the perfect hangover food or post-long run indulgence. they do have many healthier options as well we're just hooked on the qhf and can't stop. i have also loved the country burrito grits and hangover hash. they only have the qhf on saturdays (and other days) and have a different pre-fix drink included brunch menu on sundays. the coffee is delicious also. sometimes i wish the staff were a bit friendlier but they're all pretty busy running around. the absolute best part is that they're always crowded but there's almost never a wait when we go which makes for the perfect brunch spot!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
