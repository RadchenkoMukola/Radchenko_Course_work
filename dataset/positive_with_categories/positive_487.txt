"i eat at this place at least once a week.  no longer cash only which is nice since i never have any.  as a vegan i like that i have a ton of options here but that my meat-eating boyfriend is happy too.  food is a little pricey and if you get more than an entree and coffee it's easy to quickly rack up quite a bill for such a modest seeming place.  my only real complaint is the inconsistency of the service.  it's totally hit or miss.  i've never felt targeted with attitude but i have experienced long waits for the menu coffee water the check - but weirdly never the food. most of the time i leave happy sometimes irritated but i'm always full and ready for a nap.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
