"cute small restaurant with old world decor and concrete walls. the food is very good. we enjoyed the atmosphere. we tried the curry shrimp which was extraordinary. i was not expecting it to be that delicious and i would recommend it to anyone. the bread was fresh and very tasty. they had the white anchovy tower special appetizer with anchovies tomato in olive oil. this was also excellent and reasonably creative. the calamari appetizer had plenty of calamari and was very good.the zinho salad was just ok which was our single disappointment. on the plus side it had artichokes and hearts of palm. on the downside we could have prepared it at home easily; the olives were from a can and tasted bland. all in all great food minus the salad in a cozy place. the restaurant is byob but we were lucky to have bought a bottle of wine from the wine & spirits store off s. highland ave. they do not take credit cards but they said they had an atm closeby.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
