"i really wanted to like casbah after checking out the menu online.  i really wanted to like casbah once i saw the super cool dark interior of the restaurant.  unfortunately everything started to go down hill from there....the waiter was less than helpful suggesting a wine to accompany our dinner which i found to be a bit odd at such a nice restaurant.  my friend and i order split the tuna tartare and the fennel salad to start.  the tartare was decent but it lacked seasoning and i wasn't into the creme fraiche on top.  the salad was ok but nothing to rave about.  i had the short rib ravioli after reading the reviews on yelp but i didn't like the sauce that accompanied it.  my friend ordered the risotto with oyster mushrooms and she was also less than enthused.don't get me wrong nothing about my meal was terrible but nothing about my meal was spectacular either.   it looks like maybe i should have tried brunch.  we shall see if i'm willing to give casbah another chance....",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
