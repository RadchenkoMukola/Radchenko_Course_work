"2nd times a charm. this place was 3.5 starts the first time i came but stepped up large tonight.  waitress was righteous and very fun.  food was all excellent.  caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  can't wait for the leftovers!!  the white pizza is that star though.  the crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  i don't throw those accolades out easily especially on pie but this joint serves it up.  good vibe great service phenomenal food.  ill be back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
