"aw it's places like this that make me love pittsburgh. its hodge podge decor and hipster crowd are what drew me here in the first place but turns out the food and coffee is pretty decent even delicious. since it's far from where i live i don't get to come here half as often as i'd like but i'm always pleased when i do. such cute boys.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
