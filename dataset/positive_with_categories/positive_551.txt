"we recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  i am unable to eat gluten and my server (denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  she was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  i had the gf beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  she was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  we were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  i've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  never once did i feel unwelcome.  i will go out of my way to eat here again.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
