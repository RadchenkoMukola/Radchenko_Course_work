"went here for drinks and nachos and it is a very nice establishment.  the nachos were very good the drinks pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place.  there are fire places outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs.  go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumbs up.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
