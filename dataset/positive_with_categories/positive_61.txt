"coffee dry beans bulk foods fresh fruits and veggies oh my.once a staple place of mine when living in friendship and point breeze now a novelty that strikes up fond memories.  even now that i live in the north hills i still enjoy to seek out the east end food co-op on a semi-regular basis.  i go there for the bulk bins mainly but always end up grabbing some other things.  their fresh fruit and vegetable selection is always good and cheaper than whole foods and market district for sure.  i am a gigantic fan of their whole coffee bean selection as well.  very good place.  and not swarming with hippies all the time though that's not that bad of a thing.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
