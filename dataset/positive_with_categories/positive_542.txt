"one of my favorite local eateries. the mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite i wish i could purchase it. i am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. food portion is great. the only complaint i would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side as usual in most local bars. friendly service will continue to frequent with my family.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
