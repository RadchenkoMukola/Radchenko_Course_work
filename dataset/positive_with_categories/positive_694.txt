"one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh! very great food and even greater service. ask for robert he is great! ashley the bartender is also very nice! the food was amazing. i had the duck it melted in my mouth. the short rib raviolis are also amazing. the muscle appetizer is a nice size for the price. you get about a pound of muscles for 12$. i will definitely be back. they make you feel special and welcomed.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
