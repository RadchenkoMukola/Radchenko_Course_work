"for vegetarian food in pgh this place is hard to beat. the quality of the food is very good but the kitchen tends to be slow so bring a friend/book/deck of cards and the serving sizes are somewhat inconsistent. the coffee drinks are ok but i don't come here for those. i love the atmosphere of this place very laid back cozy inviting. my favorite eats are the soups and the pile-o-hashbrowns (think haystack without the artery clogging gravy).",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
