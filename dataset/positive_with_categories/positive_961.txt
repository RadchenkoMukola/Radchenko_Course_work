"this space is so beautiful.i'm always a sucker for big windows all across the front but here especially the huge windows and wide building front really opens up the space and provides excellent lighting for the front half of the cafe.the layout is unique with the island counter and bar stools in the center and plenty of tables all around. it really provides a lot of opportunities for unique corners to sit in alone and lots of space for groups.the coffee is decent. it's made from dean's beans decent fair-trade coffee and brewed to a consistent perfection. i can't speak to lattes and espressos because i've never tried them even though qs supposedly just got in a new espresso machine.the food is so-so decent vegetarian fare with the exception of most of the tofu dishes which are spectacular.and the milkshakes are always a good time even if they're a bit on the expensive side.cash-only if total is under $10.contrary to what some others have said this isn't a hipster hangout. the customers seem to be a nice mix between students locals and artists. this isn't an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink.and it does a pretty fucking good job of it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
