"the pros: great view of the city and river in good weather...  lovely for loud large groupsvaried menu with some original itemsgreat place to watch a game inside with a huge barfun locationgood place to take out of towners.the cons: the food when i went yesterday was not great.  we got the wrong sandwich our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of lots of things  (tell us when we order not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)  can be loud--not a place for a romantic date...the bathroom condition was really bad.the server did comp up an appetizer and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow. the view was great and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to pour some sugar on me  seriously?!?!?  yes!   classy eh?",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
