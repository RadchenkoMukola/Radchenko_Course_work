"my family and i go here whenever there is a special occasion and for good reason. the food is fantastic and the service cannot be beat at least not when it's coming from the governor or kennedy. best servers in the 'burgh!! i took my dad there last weekend for his 70th birthday didn't tell anyone that it was a special night out but they treated us with such attention accommodating our needs to a t. kennedy adjusted meals to fit our taste suggested things based on what we were looking for took at least 10 minutes with us going over the menu...i could go on but needless to say it was just a fabulous meal and was worth every penny. we got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start lobster bisque soup cedar plank salmon chilean sea bass and a fish medley made to order. we also always get the 7 layer carrot cake which to me is the best cake anywhere in town.  a must go for anyone looking for an amazing meal and excellent service. but be sure and ask for kennedy he's a real dude.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
