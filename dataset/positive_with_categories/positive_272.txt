"this is  a okay place to eat.  the food is nothing special.  i guess what they have going for them is the beer.  order the  guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  rice (cajun taco) was not cooked well.  would i go there again maybe.  if your into beer and watching the game then yeah go there.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
