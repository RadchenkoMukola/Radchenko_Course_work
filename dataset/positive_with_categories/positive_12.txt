"first i would like to say that i was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me to made terribly ill. that being said i came here and was delighted by my server michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp. i originally ordered the mahi mahi but alas the ran out upon my ordering in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. hence the tuna. now the tuna was amazing. seared almost perfectly with the rare flavor still intact. i would most definitely come back again and if i lived in the area this would be one of my top spots.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
