"my wife and i have been here a number of times and it's gotten better each time. some tips:- stick with the appetizers. every one we've had is fantastic. the entrees are fine but nothing special. the apps on the other hand are truly first rate.- eat as much of their bread as your stomach will let you. holy crap it's good!- it's byo so make sure to bring your favorite bottle of wine.- on a nice day inside but by the big window/door to the left. it let's in a nice breeze and makes the meal fantastic.try this place you won't regret it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
