"this is a good co-op with a generous selection for it's smallish size. prices are better here than in some co-ops i've shopped at. competitive with the big boxes as far as i can tell. i have tried some hot-bar/cafe items and quite liked them. the java jolt smoothie is amazing as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!if you can judge a town by its co-op which i am prone to do pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
