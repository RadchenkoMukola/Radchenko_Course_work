"best pizza in the north boros.  i can't make a trip to the area without stopping at luigi's.  when i was a kid the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  i prefer the thin-crust but the sicilian is also excellent.  the fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great too.  the calzones are tasty but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone you'll be disappointed.  because it's pittsburgh the chicken salad comes with french fries.  i tend to opt for take-out but there is also a mid-sized dining section.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
