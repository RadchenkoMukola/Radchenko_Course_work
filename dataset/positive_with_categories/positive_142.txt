"i think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best i've ever had in fact i never even cared for them until trying tazza d'oro's. i still hold their teas in high regard. however the food here sucks. they've always had a limited sandwich menu but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. i am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich especially in combination with caffeine. even though enrico's is an easy walk from my home i find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. i guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews but i don't think it's that hard to do both; i mean the staff seems highly competent they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. with a new lunch joint in the 'hood (park bruges) why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
