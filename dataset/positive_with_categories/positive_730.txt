"i went to casbah for brunch it's a $22 prix-fix which includes an alcoholic bev an appetizer and an entree. they use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. i had the house made granola which was just amazing! toasty and sweet it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. also while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch you get a lot a food. after the great pastry basket my appetizer a bellini and a cup of coffee i had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (the rest included fruit salad potatoes and a croissant!)my only complaint would be how long everything took. while i love a leisurely meal an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. i go into brunch groggy then i have coffee and yummy food and i'm totally amped ready to face the day! and then i get to sit. and wait. anyway it's totally not a big deal now i'll know to make time the next time i go. which is for dinner for a friends birthday. so excited!!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
