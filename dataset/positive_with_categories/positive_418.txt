"what a great find! i frequent the nearby bryant street restaurants but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. i immediately fell in love it. the baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! there were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which i will need to go back soon to try. there was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. it would be a great place to study read or visit with friends.you should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink but it is well worth it :-)",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
