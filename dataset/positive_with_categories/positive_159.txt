"i was thoroughly impressed. i am not a vegetarian but i enjoyed the variety and uniqueness of food options here. i was not upset that i wasn't eating meat at all. i also had something called a root down which is root beer and espresso and it was heavenly. my only complaint is that it seemed to be a little pricey for the type of restaurant it is. also you may have to be a young twenty something hipster/college student to enjoy it but i am a young twenty something so no complaints here.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
