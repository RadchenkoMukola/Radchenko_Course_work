"enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect pittsburgh spring night.  the charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  i had the best pasta and white clam sauce i've ever experienced and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees as well.  nice find in the point breeze neighborhood.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
