"the beer is good. their light beer lumpy dog is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. when i was pregnant i became quite a fan of their root beer floats too.as others have noted the pretzels are really good. i'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. veggie burgers are always good too though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order say the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. long long ago when i used to go to the rock bottom in boston there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
