"every time i visit qs i hope for a better experience but continue to receive poor service and ok food. i always get the feeling that the wait staff does not want you to be there. it is never friendly. it seems cold. food is ok but often taste old and like it has been reheated multiple times....ugh. i really wish they would put a lil' more effort into customer service!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
