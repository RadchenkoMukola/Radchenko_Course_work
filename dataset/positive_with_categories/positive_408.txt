"the musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd so i can't say they are all bad.  however the minimum for a song request is $5.  i spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they never played it!!  they were playing songs for $5 and $10 but my $40 got me no where.  even if they didn't know the song which i doubt they could have picked one they knew and improvised  my tip save your $$ on the requests.otherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
