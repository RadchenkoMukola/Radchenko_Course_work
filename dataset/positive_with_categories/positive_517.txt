"can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  we had a cheese tasting simply because i *never* pass up pleasant ridge reserve when given the opportunity.  they also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from cypress grove.  nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  i had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  the feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  i spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...service was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
