"this was a really interesting adventure. initially i wasn't too impressed with the produce section where it was pretty limited and only some of the fruits were worth buying. the self serve section was enormous and definitely worth checking out! there are a few things here that you may not find anywhere else. my interest in the food there was a little curbed by the prices which you could easily beat at  a regular grocery store. however the raw milk and goat milk there was an interesting find though! it's a bit out of the way but if i'm ever near bakery square i would definitely drop by!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
