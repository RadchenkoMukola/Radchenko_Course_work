"pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  the food is tasty but not transcendent.  the prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality location or portions.  the food is essentially slightly hipper olive garden fare at double the prices.for dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  but it's not all bad.  the atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  i had a good time and i'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  my friend and i were the only males there.  if cougar hunting is your sport of choice you'll feel right at home in pino's jungle safari!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
