"good pizza at a great price. the unique crust that's both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody but our whole group liked it. the sauce is good too light but with a good tomato flavor. the best thing about this place is the management. they went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast. and the prices: we fed everybody in under $40 with plenty of leftovers taken home.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
