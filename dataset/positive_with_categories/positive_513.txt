"i don't know how i would survive without this place.as a transplant from arcata ca...i need my weird hippy sh*t man. and i prefer to stay away from giant corporations like whole foods as much as possible.i always go here to buy local honey and get goat's milk soap.and they have a great selection of pre-made food (i love the tabouli and hummus wrap and the greek salad sandwich) and the salad bar is awesome.it's true that it's tiny but as someone who comes from a place that's crawling with stores like this...i feel lucky that pittsburgh has one at all. i mean people ask me where did you get that? and i say the east end co-op and then they just stare at me blankly. they have no idea what in the frak i'm talking about. the what?...where is that?there are bigger places like right by nature but it's just not the same.the co-op feels like home.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
