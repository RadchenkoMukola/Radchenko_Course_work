"it's a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences. i discovered pino's after deciding that the wait for point brugge simply wasn't worth it.the brunch was very good i enjoyed the atmosphere particularly the missing wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.my sole comment would be that the owner who was very friendly should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
