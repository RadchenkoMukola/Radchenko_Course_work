"another really good meal here!  my friend and i went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  gazpacho pasta fagiole homemade bread eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  so much food we didn't think we would eat it but it was so good we did!  they also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
