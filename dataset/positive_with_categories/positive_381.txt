"in need of healthy goodness today! parked right out front. there were a decent amount of patrons but nothing that would make me growl at the person standing in front of the thai coconut soup i so desperately wanted. first thing i did was order a wheat grass shot and my favorite juice bar drink...dante's inferno! it is a bright red drink that contains organic beets carrot celery ginger and garlic. i never get it with garlic even though you should. i can't handle that much garlic in a drink. i'm a wuss. hot foods was bumpin' but i was still able to stroll around and decide on what indian kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner. a little tofu surprise chickpea curry steamed kale steamed veggies with big slices of zucchini and a few red lentil scoops. everything looked fresh and delicious. after grabbing 2 soups and my dinner i downed my sweet wheat grass shot and was ready to get home. at the register they forgot to ring up the shot but i had to let them know. all smiles as i left. don't forget to tip the juice bar peeps.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
