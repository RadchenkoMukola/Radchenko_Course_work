"the service is great and friendly. i got the baked spinach and artichoke dip and it was superb. i love the fresh right out of the oven bread too. i got the atlantic salmon and it was probably the best fish i have ever tried. listened to other yelpers suggestion of the shang hai preparation and they were right. just make sure you make a reservation! best seafood restaurant in da burgh!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
