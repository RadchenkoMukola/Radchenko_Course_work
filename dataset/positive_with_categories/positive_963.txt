"thought it's somewhat pointless to write a review for this place. i mean every spro geeks i know of in town knows this is the best place to get a cup doppio or any espresso drink. the only reason i still decided to write this review is stupid yelp doesn't let me add a store to my list unless i have written a review for it. dah!this place is where all my fine coffee addiction started with. never did i have a cup of starbucks coffee after my first visit to tazza d'ro. not sure if it is a good thing since now i have to do a lot of research on where to get a good cup of coffee before going to a new city no matter for business or for pleasure.i love their signature bike love for all the espresso drink w/ milk. it's fruity mild and fragrant. it's addictive! the only thing i have against it is that it has pretty strong caffeine in it although it tastes super innocent. it's actually almost stronger then any spro blend i've tried.i also appreciate a lot  the community atmosphere and the effort to bring in community improvement of td.not a good place to study/work at on a weekend afternoon tho. it's too popular thus noisy.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
