"i am so happy they got rid of those awful bar stools!!!   we often choose not to walk in to casbah without a reservation because the bar area was historically uncomfortable.  they have traded out the old stools that were screwed in to the floor too far from your companions and didn't comfortably turn to face people (who thought that was a good idea?) in for some admittedly less attractive but functional chairs  i'm a big fan of the lunch and dinner there--we'll add that more often to our walk-in list now",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
