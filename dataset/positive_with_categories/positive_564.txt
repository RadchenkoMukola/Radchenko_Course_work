"i called for a delivery of a pepperoni pizza large. very simple since i was in the mood for it. the delivery and the time taken were exceptional. very fast very good delivery service. the down side is the pizza. it was hot and fresh but the flavor was just ok. it wasn't the best nor was it the worst. it was just ok.if you do find that you like your pizza and need a quick delivery you can't go wrong here. other than that you may want to look elsewhere.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
