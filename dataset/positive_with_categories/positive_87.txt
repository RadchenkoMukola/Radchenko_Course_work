"such a pleasure to dine on my birthday at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in shadyside. we planned in advance to come here after i received big burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. the food--short rib ravioli lamb and polenta pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent perfect for a celebratory meal. our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. my favorite: the local martini all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.after reading everyone else's reviews i hope to come back here next for brunch.**to take big burrito up on this offer join their mailing list decently before your birthday and a voucher will come in the mail! it was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
