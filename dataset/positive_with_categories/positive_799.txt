"hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  yinzes say it's pricey but i disagree the quality is hard to find period.  very progressive menu but not too wild products are from near area farms very knowledgable staff.  and butter served at the right temperature that's a novel idea!  just a great experience can't wait to get back there.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
