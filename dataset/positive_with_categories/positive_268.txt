"i have been coming to casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  i very much like the place and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  over the years i have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  i have ever encountered (although i no longer eat mammals so they are likely to be the best pork chops i will ever eat).  this is not an inexpensive place it can be quite pricey for dinner.  one plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on sundays.  their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  my one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. i always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  this cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.others may disagree but even though this is a fairly fancy place it is suitable for children.  casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  my wife and i have often dined here with our kids.  this semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  you can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
