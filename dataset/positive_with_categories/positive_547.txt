"i have to say that i've only been here when it was very busy. i found the service fairly quick and any of the food i've had has been delicious. i went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. without going into detail i will say they handled it wonderfully. our waitress mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. i had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. i had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. i would go back again!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
