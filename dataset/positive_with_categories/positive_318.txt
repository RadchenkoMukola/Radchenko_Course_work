"it's disappointing that you got lukewarm service erina.  i've had pretty consistently good vibes (har har--get it?--hippie reference) there from the staff who've been enthusiastic about helping me find what i need.  hands down this place beats whole foods for price and general atmosphere and their salad and hot bar is my go-to when i don't feel like cooking.  absolutely great bulk section with a wide variety of grains legumes and pastas.  killer cookies and baked goods.  on the other hand--if i lived on my own i could do all my shopping here.  but since i don't--i can't.  it's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the eefc--i mean i can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.  realistically the co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.  but it's worth it to put down a few extra pennies for potatoes or juice to support a genuinely community-oriented business.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
