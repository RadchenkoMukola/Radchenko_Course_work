"this review is on lunch at buffalo blues. i have been here a number of times for dinner and for late-night drinks and have always thought it was a great place to grab a drink and watch a game but haven't been overly impressed with the food. that is until yesterday. i came in for a quick bite to eat and ordered the hot veggie sandwich. it was fantastic - the best veggie sandwich i have had here in pittsburgh. other than that service was good and fairly quick. i made have found my new go-to lunch spot!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
