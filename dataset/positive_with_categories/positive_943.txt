"it seems silly to rate a chain so i won't talk about the food. i just love coming to this panera because it's right by barnes and noble.  i recently started getting into the panera card. compared to the other paneras i have to say that this one seems cleaner bigger and all around nicer.  of course i would never go out of my way to get here but if you're at barnes and noble and aren't happy with the sandwiches there (which i was) i would venture on over to panera.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
