"the food and customer service from this restaurant are really top notch.  i am continually impressed with how fast the delivery is and how likeable the drivers are.the pizzas here are excellent as long as you don't get the crab meat topping (i should have expected gross imitation crab meat since we're so far from the coast).the breadsticks jalapeno poppers and wings are also delicious.some of the best pizza in pennsylvania.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
