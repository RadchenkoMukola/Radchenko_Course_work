"i came into quiet storm not intending to have lunch but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while (working from home makes me stir crazy so bouncing around local coffeehouses completely not fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes). i walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. i didn't need to but  ... good lookin' out. anyway ordered my latte - good espresso but pretty weak foam. served in a pint glass. that's fine. menu actually looked really good so i went for a sammy with apples seitan sausage crumbles and cheese. they offer different sides but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what i wanted; so being a newbie i figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. i was wrong when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. my fault for not speaking up. sandwich was good not to die for though and frankly kinda small for $8. i'll finish with this: internets are free right? so where's the code? did i need to ask??i'll definitely go back though intrigued by a few other things on the menu (like bbq tenders and pulled 'pork' quesadilla) and hopefully be a little more impressed.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
