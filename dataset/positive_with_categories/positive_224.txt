"checked out the neighborhood restaurant for sunday brunch. the portions were generous and the omelets were very good. we felt that much of the food (e.g. sides) and service were just average. for example we typically had to ask for coffee to be refilled. it is a great place to go for a quick bite to eat on a sunday morning but i would not make a special trip to the restaurant.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
