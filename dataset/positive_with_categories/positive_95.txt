"an excellent choice for fresh well prepared seafood located in the waterfront area in homestead.   i frequent this area for business travel and you can't do much better without heading downtown.the seafood is excellent with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials a raw bar and a list of chef's specialties.  the house salad is sweet and delicious and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious healthy and unique.  try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.there is a nice selection of regional beers on tap a decent selections of wines and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  the deserts are adequate though not a highlight.  if you're on the waterfront you won't do better than this.  enjoy!",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
