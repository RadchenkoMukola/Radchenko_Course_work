"i'm not really into chain restaurants but my mom's in town so.... you know. the mains are basically a half notch classier than a chinese take out but i'm just not impressed. $15 for a small portion of orange chicken that is about as good as a cheap takeout seems silly. where i think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads i know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad. the salad lacks any creativity and the soup was just a bowl of salty beef water.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
