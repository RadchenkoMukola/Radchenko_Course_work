"a decent italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus flat breads salads soups and pasta. outdoor seating is available in nice weather and the service is friendly. overall not a bad place but not super exciting either - pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  point brugge cafe. it also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
