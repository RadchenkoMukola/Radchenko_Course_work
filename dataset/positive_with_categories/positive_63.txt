"came here on a monday night.  boy was the place dead!  i was the only only customer at 8:30pm.  ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese pepperoni and mushrooms.  it was pretty good.  could of used more cheese.   i wasn't in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza. this is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the us.  it was just like the others.  the caesar salad with anchovies was very good.  the service was very poor.  my waitress spent a lot of time chit-chatting with the hostess.  it was a chore to get water refills from her.  they have big screen televisions in the bar area which can be seen from the restaurant.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
