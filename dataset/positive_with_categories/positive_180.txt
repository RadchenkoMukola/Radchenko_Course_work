"in my opinion casbah is the best of the big burrito restaurants. i have been to casbah for dinner and drinks a few times. during my latest experience i was impressed by the hearty fall entrees. i decided to take my husband to casbah for his birthday on friday night. i called on monday and luckily i was able get a reservation without a problem. when we arrived the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. we were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area. we decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs. this was my favorite part of the meal. i could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! the polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. delish. you have to try these! for my entree i ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. the huge pork chop arrived medium well as requested but was still tender and juicy even better when dipped in the sage jus. in additiion the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. my husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. the mussels clams shrimp halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. i was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. we're talking the width of a coffee cup! unfortunately we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal. if you are looking for a place to enjoy good wine amazing food and a pleasant atmosphere casbah is for you.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
