"i am a huge fan of almost all things big burrito and casbah is no exception.  i have been to casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together but on this particularly occasion i had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious and my friend had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed.  we both ordered the the scottish salmon which was so delicious and tender that it literally melted in my mouth.  the house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which i've had both on a few occasions.  their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit i had a glass of the riesling from urban germany and my friend had a glass of pinot grigio from lenotti italy.  we had no room for dessert on this visit but any of their desserts that have the meyer lemons is always a hit and i am a die-hard chocolate fan and i will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  i haven't been to casbah for brunch in quite some time but after having gone to eleven recently for brunch i'm keen to try casbah for brunch again soon.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
