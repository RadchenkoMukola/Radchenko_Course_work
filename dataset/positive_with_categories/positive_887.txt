"fast food done right what more can you want?a throwback to old timey diners steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. my sisters and i arrived on a tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. this meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! i ordered the western bbq burger which was 2 thin patties cheese bacon bbq sauce and fried onions. it came with shoe string fries (my favorite) all for the low price of $4.79. are you kidding me? what's not to like! the food was actually pretty good! i liked it a lot. since it was happy hour i also splurged on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. it was meh. could have gone without it. the overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off but the hot fudge saved it. but how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?all in all 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. a steal. also the food is good! i enjoyed it. i'd come back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
