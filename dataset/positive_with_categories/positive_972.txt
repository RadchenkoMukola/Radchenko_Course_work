"no pictures!  i knew i should have taken my camera!my aunt and i went there today for mother's day.  i think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty cheap (i've been to the one in columbus).  my aunt had a chicken dinner (grilled chicken green beans and potatoes with butter) and i had their shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp a couple of scallops and a nice piece of salmon all done perfectly.  we didn't order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie!  anyway dinner was great and so was the service thus the five stars!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
