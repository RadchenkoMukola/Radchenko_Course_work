"came here with a group of girls and didn't have a reservation. we paid the cover walked in and it was absolutely packed. there was nowhere to even stand. one of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in they let us get our $7 cover back without issue. i recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. people who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group. they brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. there are only about 6 beers on top so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices. they also have mixed drinks and wine. the mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines (despite what it says on the menu). the entertainment was great and i would recommend it for a group outing. but definitely make sure that you have a reservation.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
