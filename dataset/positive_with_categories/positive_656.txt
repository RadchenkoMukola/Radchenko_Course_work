"don't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard cinnamon butter and a spicy queso dip. the queso is my favorite but they were all delish. i also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious. 5-7 m-f is 1/2 off appetizers so i was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal. the menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad. we didn't get drinks but some looked good...",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
