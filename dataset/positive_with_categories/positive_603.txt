"a taste of ca in pa.  we walked in and i would swear i was in santa monica or hermosa  beach.  great atmosphere- creative menu and delicious food.  the steak was to die for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.  they also have a nice wine list.  the french chardonnay was quite good!thanks for making me feel at home.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
