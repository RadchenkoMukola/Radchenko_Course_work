"outstanding lattes. period. the service can be *very* slow but the latte is worth the wait. and the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers but they make darn good lattes so who cares.tucked in the beautiful highland park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful bryant street restaurants tazza d'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. a nice short walk from highland park is a welcome plus. get the latte take a stroll down the street to explore the houses and take a walk in the park. that is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you. they also have food but i cannot speak for that. the interior is somewhat run down at places but that gives it character.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
