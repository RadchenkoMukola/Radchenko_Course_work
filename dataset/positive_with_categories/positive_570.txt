"ball park pretzel-would eat again. i came to rock bottom looking for a great beer. full of hops that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. i then opened the menu scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. i saw an extensive list of items from chicken fingers to salads. i noticed a ball park pretzel with a jalape√±o cheese dip. i was blown away the fact that i got 2 pretzels amazed me. i ordered within 25 minutes of seating. my pretzels hit the table within minutes. the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. but i knew we could step this shit up i asked for mustard. and what do you know. grey poupon dijon mustard is in front of my eyes. i combined that shit and life evolved. i went to heaven it took me 35 minutes to write this review because i took a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence. good look rock bottom keep up the good work.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
