"i'm not much of a beer drinker but my fiancee is a major enthusiast so i agreed to tag along.  i'm glad i did!  our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection and helped me to pick one i would love (the kolsch was very crisp light and drinkable.)  the food was standard pub fare with a twist well-executed.  my burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola and cooked to perfection.  the waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side which was definitely a good choice.  my only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy and i spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  not sure i would make the hour+ trip to pittsburgh again but if i found myself in the city i may just stop by.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
