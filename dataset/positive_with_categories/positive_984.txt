"i ate here at around 8:00 on a saturday night.  reading the other reviews it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant i was.  sure it isn't a world class dining establishment but it is decent considering it is a chain.  you should know that going into any chain really.  it was basically exactly what i expected in terms of food quality and price.we were greeted immediately upon entering and while the hostess went to grab menus another server asked us if we were taken care of.  service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  i ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which i would prefer receiving my food.  my fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  it was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  i had the potato skin appetizer.  it reminds me of a baked potato pizza that i used to enjoy at a local place back in buffalo.  it was delicious especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.overall it doesn't even come close to visiting an uno's in chicago but then again when does a copy every live up to the original?  it won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to chicago.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
