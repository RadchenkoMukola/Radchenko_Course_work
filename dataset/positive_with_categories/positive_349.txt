"i don't think i would have known about quiet storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' yelp feeds in the last couple years.  i'm all about veg/vegan restaurants but i have to agree with other reviewers who wish quiet storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  husband and i ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at schenley park overlook.  folks working were vegan-hipster quirky but friendly and helpful.  we ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  i  had an iced morroccan latté with cardamom and rose  husband the mandorla sweet almond milk latté.  both were excellent.for my meal i picked the tahini bowl with brown rice spinach roasted red pepper tomatoes pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  i wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  husband opted for the crunch wrap extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery carrots edamame kale and spinach dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  again twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.and that's just it: the food at quiet storm is fine.  when really i'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables plain grains and humble legumes.  still i won't discourage you from eating here.  i just might come back myself.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
