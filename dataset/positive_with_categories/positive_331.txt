"the interior is very nice. the food is a hit or miss. we went for brunch today. you can select a drink (alcoholic or non) an appetizer and a brunch entree for the price of $22. the appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. the entrees on the other hand left a lot to be desired. we got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. the omelet was very bland. it did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. basically i have had better omelets at some denny's. my drink mimosa was just ok. my girlfriend's blood mary was delicious though -- uniquely spicy. i have been to casbah 4 times last time being for brunch today. the first time it was good worthy of 4 stars. it gradually went down to 3 stars. the wine selection is good. but the food is definitely hit or miss. once i had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. it was not well cooked or fresh or something. consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
