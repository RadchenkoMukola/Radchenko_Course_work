"my best friend and i went here for dinner today and were very pleased - though i do have to say that we both had our free birthday entrees and that undoubtedly influenced things.  i was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons but everything was good.we started with two big glasses of sangria.  i thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or i got used to it.i had the risotto with morels peas and scallions which was delicious.  i had never had morels before and now i understand why they're so pricey.  there was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto but they were delicious.  the risotto was very creamy and flavorful the kind i wish i could make myself.  my best friend had the short rib ravioli which she really enjoyed.  i tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.we split a creme brulee for dessert and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote happy birthday on the rim which was a nice touch.  the creme brulee was good but definitely not the best i've ever had.  (that award may go to soba's coffee creme brulee.)the total bill would have been $72 which seems a bit steep.  but it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  the patio was lovely.  i will definitely be back if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
