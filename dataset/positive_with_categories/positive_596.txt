"an absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. however we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. no gin or vermouth was used it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.anyway the small plates made for good upscale bar food. half-price apps make for a cheap but nice dinner and a movie - great great specials. however i would not buy a full-priced dinner here. nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. the baked goat cheese was small but delicious and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.be warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. seriously the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
