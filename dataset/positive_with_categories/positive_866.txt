"to be honest i feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. the food is average to good the place is beautiful with outdoor seating but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. they have a really good happy hour so i would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
