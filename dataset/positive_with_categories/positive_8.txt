"we've all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on. then once you finally do you realize how many opportunities you wasted!rock bottom is definitely a solid bar. as a microbrewery their beer list is full of house brews. there are better beers in the world but there are a lot of worse beers out there too. what really makes rock bottom standout though is the food. my girlfriend and i shared an order of nachos and it took everything we had to finish them. they also make a mean soft pretzel. the waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh but no trip to the waterfront is complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
