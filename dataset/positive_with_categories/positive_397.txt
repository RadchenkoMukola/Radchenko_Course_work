"i've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and i'm sorry but i don't wholly agree with well everyone else; so here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  i'm aware like many reviewers on this site that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. yes the coffee is good and if i happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot i'm sure i'd stop in to get it again.  but the place itself was a turn off despite the interesting people that it attracts.  glossy refinished exposed wood beams fake grape vines over the windows and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere i can't overlook or sit in.  i think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
