"this place is kind of a hybrid of applebee's and cpk which isn't to say it's bad but nothing to rave about either. i got their slider meal which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). the food was fine and the service was okay but really felt like an applebee's knockoff (and applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway). 3 stars",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
