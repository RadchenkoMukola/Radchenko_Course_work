"i walked in to this business and immediately knew i could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor quality or technique and i was absolutely correct. the espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. my accomplice's americano was equally well made not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. i regret that i didn't notice the manual bar menu before i ordered i've been dying to try a pour-over coffee and i know it would have been delicious. pro-tip: there is no sign for the unisex restroom which is to the left of the service area past the bulletin corkboard.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
