"in similar fashion to joseph s. i too decided to give pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby point brugge which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation was. it was a relatively nice evening and i thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. we were immediately greeted by jen one of the co-owners as we entered. i made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop and she volunteered some additional information about their production that i found to be very interesting. i really loved the bistro burger. i requested it to be prepared medium and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times i've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. nicole our waitress proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. we also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. i thought the ziti was a bit dry but the sauce and cheese were delicious. we really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. i was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. my partner's ravioli looked delicious and he let me try one of his meatballs which i found to have that homemade flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. our friend loved her arugula salad and as a seafood aficionado i was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. overall we loved our experience and will be back! we were told about pino's legendary sunday brunches and i look forward to trying one myself the next sunday i have off from work.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
