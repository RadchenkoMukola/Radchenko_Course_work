"not bad for neighborhood corner chinese food. the szechwan is not good. too much...ketchup?? the wonton soup is good.  very good curry chicken with onion and happy family. egg rolls are hit or miss. sometimes they can be a little underdone. is this the best place? no...but it does the trick especially for a hangover cure.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
