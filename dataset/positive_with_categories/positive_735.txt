"i'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. what could be wrong with playing old and new school games drinking and eating all at the same place? the one thing i can think of is the price. on the surface this is a pretty expensive place; however they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go whether or not you donate money to the make-a-wish foundation and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! but honestly know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. in regards to the games there's a plethora for your enjoyment. although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets the last couple of times i've gone i've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (mario kart anyone?!). either way it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
