"my girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last saturday. i highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. there were people there waiting 30 minutes+. we had the sangria which was amazing. our sever alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  i had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. my two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  i will be back for sure.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
