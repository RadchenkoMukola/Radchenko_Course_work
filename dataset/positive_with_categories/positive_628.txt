"who would have thought that a vegan-friendly hipster restaurant would be one of the best places in pittsburgh to feed a hangover? seriously go hungover and you will be in love. get a super-stuffed burrito. they put mashed potatoes in burritos along with hearty beans scrambled eggs and cheese and yummy salsa. your stomach will thank you. while you're waiting have some coffee. at under $10 for a very filling burrito and a bottomless cup of coffee i thought it was a great deal. in addition to their regular menu they also have daily specials and themed brunches. i can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. it's great to have a full-service restaurant where you can get oodles of vegetarian items.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
