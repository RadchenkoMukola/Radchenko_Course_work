"went here for the first time this past weekend. needless to say i'll be returning! it was a blast!!!it was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. what is wrong with these people?! everything if you ask me! seriously though if you're going to reserve a table you better freaking go! i had no complaints about the place itself! the guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! anddd this has to be the only place i've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk because the comedians take no prisoners! i did enjoy when matt and joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! they are great at what they do. can't wait to go back!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
