"another one of pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  the best things about casbah are it's very cool atmosphere good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).i had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection) and several appetizers soups and salad.  everything was delicious especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers and i really liked they even gave them credit on the menu the first time i have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? after all they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).the atmosphere is really cool i recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  the only negative things i can say about casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (i expected more of a middle eastern menu and vibe).",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
