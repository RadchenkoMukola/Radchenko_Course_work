"i stopped by here today with my fianc√© for a quick slice of pizza for myself.  i had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from a pop cooler a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. the temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  we were greeted almost immediately on entering and i ordered a plain slice.  a few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  i was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  upon opening it i was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  the pizza itself ended up being really solid.  on it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  the crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  as a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.the bottom line for me is that i would eat here again in the future.  i liked the pizza that i had here and may even order a whole one in the future.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
