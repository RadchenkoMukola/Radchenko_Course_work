"this is a great place for happy hour to catch the game or to have a small-ish private party. definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials but mon-fri from 5-7pm they have $1 off all drafts1/2 priced blues booze$5 nachos and quesadillas$5 basket of wings (10 pieces)east end beers are $3 all day every day.the food here is not spectacular but i've always enjoyed what i've gotten. being from the south i wouldn't think to order the bbq or catfish here so i can't vouch for those. the spicy wings cheese sticks salads and grilled cheese are all good. the regulars and servers are pretty nice people. we watched the saint/steelers game here (with our saints attire on!) and easily made friends the whole night. they also have a small loft area that you can reserve for free for a private party and you're supplied a waitress for the evening. finally they deliver! i love having another delivery option besides chinese and pizza. now i can be lazy and eat a big salad!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
