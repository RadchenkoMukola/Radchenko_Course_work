"the coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasn't anything spectacular.  it was also exceptionally busy and me and my three friends had to crowd around a teeny tiny table.  all of us felt like the panini/burritos were totally edible and good just not great.  the flavors just weren't super tasty.  i would say yay on coming here for coffee sort of yay on coming for food.it kind of bothers me that it shows up as the number one restaurant in pittsburgh.  i mean it definitely does not deserve that ranking.  i wouldn't want out-of-towners coming to pittsburgh and thinking that's the best we have.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
