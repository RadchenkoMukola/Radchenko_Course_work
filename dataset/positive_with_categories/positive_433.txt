"we're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the waterfront (they do exist...) and this has become a favorite. i've had the hot roast beef & fries and the corned beef on rye and both were delicious. every beer i've had here has been ice cold and the service has been strong too. it's a great place to watch a pirates game too.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
