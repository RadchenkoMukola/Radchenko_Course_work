"it was the first time that i went to this location.  we sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  i had the bbq burger with fries.  for the price of the burger i expected something much better.  it was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  as a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  in addition their drinks are expensive!  just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  there are enough restaurants at the waterfront that i don't know that i will come back here.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
