"i'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   the food is pretty good but nothing to rave about.  the menu has a good variety and everything i've tried has been good.  portions are large.  one side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several tv's & 2 pool tables.  it's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  the other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  in general it has a relaxed atmosphere.  i've always had quick & friendly service.  i love the whole waterfront area....so much to do!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
