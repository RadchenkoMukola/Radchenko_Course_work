"the fare is pretty standard for a natural/ vegan/ vegetarian spot: lots of tofu tempeh veggies and combinations thereof in burrito or bowl form. that said it is particularly fresh flavorful and carefully prepared. quiet storm has a really nice vibe and feel to it and the spice lovers among us will relish the bottles of sriracha diners are allowed to have their way with at each table. but what i really came here to talk about are the milkshakes. ohemgee. i don't even know how to describe them to you. the vegan ones are just delectably decadent and so thick that you can barely drink it through a straw. there are so many flavors that you cannot possibly decide which would be the most scrumptious (answer: they all are!). but i'd urge you toward anything involving peanut butter. too bad i was just visiting (or maybe that's good- i would not be able to stay away!).",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
