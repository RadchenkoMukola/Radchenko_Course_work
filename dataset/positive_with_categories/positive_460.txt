"i gotta give my man jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  the upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  i can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  he's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  steve and clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  this is only my second 5 star review probably should deserve 4.5 but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  the food is still great the patio is nice the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  i do wish he had more options than just italian wine but last night we were able to find a great white.  the salmon carpaccio last night is the best i've ever had.  the mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  i  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for douglas dick at bona terra).  in my original post i said it was a bit pricey but i've decided it's well worth the cost now.  i also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  there's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
