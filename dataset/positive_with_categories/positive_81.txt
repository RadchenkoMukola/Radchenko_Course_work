"i love good vegetarian options! immediately upon stepping into quiet storm you'll realize their myriad of owl decor and local art hanging on the walls and counter top. the place is comfortable and is perfect if you want to just relax and read the paper. this little cafe has it all - milkshakes to die for vegan baked goods yummy breakfast burritos and killer french toast. their imitation meat was average compared to some other one's i've had - but it's not something to harp on. the service was pretty fast and friendly as well so remember to tip well!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
