"my friend and i were having a weekend trip to pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on sunday before our visit to the nearby pittsburgh glass center. we weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!we weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. friend ordered the nyam which she said was very filling (surprisingly). i had the the country burrito which definitely surpassed my expectations. decent good. friend & i both ordered the don juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! amazingly good- i always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. i'm only sad that i can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. might not necessarily go out of my way to come back but i would definitely go again if i were in the area. :)",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
