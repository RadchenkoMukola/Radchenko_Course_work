"had lunch here after getting my nails done in the waterfront.  it's your standard panera - lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows.  our food was made very quickly even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a saturday).  chicken noodle soup is tasty but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  i tried their sierra chicken sandwich for the first time and it was pretty good.  it's very flavorful i like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  it was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.if i have to get a quick light meal and only chain options are available panera is my best choice.  it's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  but there isn't much special about it of course.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
