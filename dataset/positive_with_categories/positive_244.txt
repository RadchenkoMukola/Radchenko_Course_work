"this is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on pittsburgh's east end.  it is also a haven for the vegan/vegetarian hipster.  i've been a handful of times now and only once did i get food i wasn't happy with.  prices are reasonable maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  keeping this place open is well worth that cost.if you aren't feeling so hungry this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid.  check out the milkshakes!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
