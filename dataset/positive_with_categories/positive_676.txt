"note: tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lottasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good especially considering the price. before i continue i will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(as was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(i assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  however i will chalk some of it up to my mistake because i thought they closed a half hour later  than they did and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. so tasty you get a pass on the riceanyhow i ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(i've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). i ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. also the tofu was in very large chunks which has seemed to be my luck lately. i want surface area and i don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. i will say though that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.the eggroll as i said was tough.. it tasted good but it was tough and small... this probably won't be in my future order however with the $10 minimum i do need to order something else with my tofu... i hope the soup is good.the lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when i ordered. portion size was good for the $10.44 it cost me i'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
