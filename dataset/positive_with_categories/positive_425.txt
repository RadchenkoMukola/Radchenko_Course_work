"i was vegan for years vegetarian for about 9 years or so. this is a good place for those of us who are trying to eat mainly vegetarian (i.e. me now) or strict vegetarians / vegans. i like it here but the service isn't always great. i've had a negative encounter with the manager / owner before...it was years ago so hopefully her customer service skills have grown since then.other than that the food has never been bad and normally the servers are chill and nice. don't expect to get your food on the fly.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
