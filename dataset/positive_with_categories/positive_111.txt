"this update is for casbah's brunch.alright casbah. you got me you got me good. dinner as i mentioned before was decent but the brunch amazing. compared to dinner brunch at casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. i don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family but sometimes you can't help it. brother brunch gets the nod here.brunch is basically a fixed set. for $28 you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic) an appetizer and an entree. they start you off with some pistachio scones buttermilk biscuits and cornbread. perfect i like to stretch before i get my grub on. for my prix-fixe (fixed set) i went with the mimosa smoked salmon and sea scallop fry. smoked salmon: if you like smoked salmon then you would enjoy this appetizer. it's what you would expect but also a larger size than i thought it would be! oh no there's too much of something i like said nobody ever. upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg red onion and aioli garnished over top my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! sea scallop fry: you know i love me some scallops. the dish came with two scallops a small croissant small bits of fennel sausage a side of white corn grits and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. i was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree but i am so glad i put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. it's not your typical brunch dish and it's one i would definitely recommend. all in all fantastic brunch experience. definitely felt comfortably full but not in a self-hatred i-regret-this-decision-immediately kind of way. service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
