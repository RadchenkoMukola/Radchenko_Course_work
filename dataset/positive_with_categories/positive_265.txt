"i had lunch here on a hot saturday so we skipped the outdoor seating in the front and opted for the air-conditioned interior. the sweet corn fondue appetizer was a definite highlight of the lunch.  i had thought that the cheese might drown out the flavor of the corn but both flavors held their own very well.  the chanterelle mushroom and goat cheese omelet i had as my entree was okay but not outstanding.  i did however enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.  dessert was a semolina cake with macerated fresh peaches and cream cheese ice cream (think cheesecake flavored).  the bookends of my meal were so delicious that i wasn't all that disappointed by the middle portion of it.while i can't afford casbah on a regular basis as a grad student the prices aren't exorbitant.  there's even a lunch special for $14 which gives you two courses: either a salad or cup of soup and your choice of a pasta risotto or half a sandwich.  i didn't choose this option but it seems like a reasonably-priced way to sample several things on the menu.our server was very professional and checked on us after every course (the appetizer entrees and dessert).  i'll definitely keep casbah in mind for special occasions in the future.  it's classy without being pretentious or stuffy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
