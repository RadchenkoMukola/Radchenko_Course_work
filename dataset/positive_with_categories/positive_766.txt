"my local sports bar.  it has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is my neck isn't cramped and i don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.  it is a bar.  it has bar food.  nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries sandwhiches and wings.  on the other hand i've never had a bad experience either.  so when i eat there i'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular but i am expecting constantcy.  consistancy is what is delivered.  buffalo blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.  service is spotty i do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when i go there.  the plus is when specific staff is working the  place is that much of a better establishment.  consistantly just above average in my opinion.i chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  i would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich i'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
