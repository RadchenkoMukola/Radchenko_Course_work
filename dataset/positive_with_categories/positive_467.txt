"went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a sunday. anyway we got the brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! yum. we sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines. for my 2 courses i got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. it was honestly amazing. i loved it. it came with some almonds and some cranberries but the polenta itself was great. i would come back just to have that for breakfast. for the main dish i got a crab omelette. it came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. the potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. not the best i have had but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.it was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. this place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. we had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
