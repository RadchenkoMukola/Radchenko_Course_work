"i must say my experience last night at bar louie was wonderful. i was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here but my husband convinced me to give it a try. the place is seat yourself and it's loud in there. i was a little underwhelmed by that at first but i got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy.our service was fantastic. courtney was great - super attentive brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes brought our food quickly checked on us just enough... and the place was packed.the drinks were perfect just strong enough. we tried the peach lighting and the tiki drink. i liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. there were real berries mixed into that one. yum.on to the food... my turkey/ham/brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. the highlight of the meal though was the whiskey cake. sonnet-worthy.we'll definitely go back again.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
