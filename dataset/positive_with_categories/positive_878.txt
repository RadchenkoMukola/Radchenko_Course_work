"there is nothing like this in chicago!  (that i know of).....i hope i get to stay in pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  i love the bulk section especially since i can choose the quantity of what i want to buy.  super convenient for travelers.  you can buy pasta granolla flour quinoa cous cous cane sugar spices yerba mate!!! dried fruit nuts olive oil peanut & almond butter soap.....man i could go on & on.  you can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  i was suprised that they had cacao powder for such a small place.  they have a nice little section of tofu tempeh & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  they also have a juice bar & vegetarian cafe.  i don't think i'd call it a cafe more like buffet.  i wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked but i'm not going to penalize them for that.  for such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  i really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  there must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because i heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  everyone was very curteous and nice.  i should try to make friends with these people since i'm new in town.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
