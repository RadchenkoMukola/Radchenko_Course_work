"spices spices spices! best deal in town when you run out of something and don't want to pay $7 for another bottle of parsley at giant eagle. i also appreciate the affordable selection of local milk products eggs bread (allegro hearth yum!)  and honey. one gripe - salad mix it's 4.99 a bag! you can get the same salad mix at tj's for 1.99 2.99 if you want organic. and currently most of the produce is shipped from other states/countries. i don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
