"because i have significantly younger sisters i go to dave and busters about twice a year. it's fun for them and nostalgic for me. it can get expensive and the 'prizes' are cheap but it make for great sister days as for the food we've eaten there once and never again. it's just blah... frozen and fried. the veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it. a frozen boca patty thrown on a bun. thanks! i could have ran to costco for that. drinks are rather expensive but that's to be expected. so go for the games fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat (skip the bountiful chains that span the waterfront and try blue dust on amity street).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
