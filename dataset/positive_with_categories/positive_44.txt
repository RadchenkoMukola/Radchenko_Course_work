"another good meal ... this time the housemade meatloaf. it's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. a refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. the server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. service was prompt just the same. overall good experience.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
