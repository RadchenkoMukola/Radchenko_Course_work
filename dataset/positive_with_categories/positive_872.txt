"this used to be my secret place but i've told so many people about it that i have a hard time getting a reservation.  i've known jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  he's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  i had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in march and jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  he arranged for a dj last time so we were able to dance off some of his food.  okay the food is great.  i especially recommend the veal chop.  the staff is awesome. i really like marney and errol (two main servers) and i like jordan the bartender upstairs (marney's daughter).  i'd like to give this place 5 stars but it has a few smaller problems.  it's a little bit pricey.  the good is that the cost does include salad pasta and bread but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  the veal chop is $65.  that's a little much especially considering the location.  the dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  i mean literally you can three meals out of one entree  i would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  one last tip even though it's not byob anymore you can still byob.  he won't turn you away.  this is one of my favorite restaurants.  the chef is really talented and i'd hazard a guess that if he was in new york he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  he's got the personality.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
