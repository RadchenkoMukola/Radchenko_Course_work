"love this place so much. the food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied. the service is incredibly slow though takes forever to our meals! even during lunch time when there's almost no one there.. i don't understand i always end up eating here for at least two-four hours. fish is always fresh lobster is delicate and tasty and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well. clam chowder is rich and creamy-- perfect thickness! love their salads as well. definitely recommend this place for a date night :) pricey? definitely be prepared to spend at least $20/person!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
