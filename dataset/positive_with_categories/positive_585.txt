"wednesday is wing night i.e. eat your face off night. for ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. if you can top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.i've mostly had the wings at blues & i like all of the sauces but the burgers are good as well. whatever you do make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (especially if her name is meg).",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
