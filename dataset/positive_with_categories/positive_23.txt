"casbah is more like a 3.5 but i rounded down:)  we arrived after happy hour at soba apparently owned by the same people for dinner.  there were four of us and they started us out with delicious drinks.  i had the margarita topped with malbec which was surprisingly yummy. for appetizers we tried the meatballs and the grilled trip of flatbreads with mediterranean dips.  for mains i had the rare seared tuna andrea had the salmon and allejandro and elie both had the gnocchi.  everything was ok to start and the mains were all good although they rely heavily on butter and huge portions for their mainstay of flavor and satisfaction.  it was interesting to have such big portions after nyc where i'm used to portion control but i decidedly prefer more reasonable portions (maybe somewhere in between). all in all a nice garden pleasant and a good place for conversation.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
