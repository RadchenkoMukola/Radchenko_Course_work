"i was expecting a lot more from jt but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way. it merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu. the idea was cute. they even have typical chinese lunch specials.the deco needs upgrading and dusting -- some lighting or even natural light (its like walking in a cave!) and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air. i had a craving for comfort food and ordered jajangmyeon and grilled calamari. the tea and water was served as i sat down. i went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people. the calamari came out promptly and the jajangmyeon took a little longer. the portions were huge! what took the longest and annoyed me the most (i was the only one left at the restaurant) was waiting for the check. why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes? they never came the clear the table or walked by so that i could signal that i needed the check. i should have just walked out. the food was okay but i seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn't help with. you may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
