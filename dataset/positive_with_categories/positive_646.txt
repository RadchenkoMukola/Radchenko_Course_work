"ventos is an east end tradition.   the sicilian style pizza is the bomb!   it is more of a traditional working-clasd pittsburgh style crust-square and bread like.  sicilian pizza comes in square cuts by the way  if you like the doughy (dominos or similar) kind of pizza crust or brick oven designer pizza you might not like vento's pizza.  but i happen to love vento's pizza!!!   they also have subs and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  this is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood  everything i've had from here is good.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
