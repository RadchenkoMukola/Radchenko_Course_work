"man haters gonna hate.  listen y'all bar louie isn't fancy.  it's just not and their extensive martini list won't fool me.  however the food is good ole american bar grub and their beer selection is decent.  the staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers.  as long as bar louie still keeps having $1 burger days (tuesdays) and $1 beer days (wednesdays) i will continue to be a fan.  fyi it's a fanatically cheap movie & dinner/drinks weekday date spot.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
