"our family loves this restaurant.  my children and i suffer from food allergies.   i have celiac's disease and their gluten free selection for a chinese restaurant is great.  my children are a completely different ball game.  they have a rare disease called eosinophilic esophagitus where food attacks their body.  they are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten soy eggs dairy nuts tree nuts fish shellfish amd corn.  this restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  the servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  our favorite manager is joe and favorite server is kevin.  call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
