"it was just what we were looking for. the service was great. my husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. it was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. i had the stuffed eggplant. that was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. i would definitely go back. really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
