"great atmosphere and rather humble especially for a chain restaurant. the service is always friendly even if they are busy. i enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. i highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
