"so i went back to casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. the granola i had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. the service was better at dinner then at brunch but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. definitely go for brunch! but it's not worth the money for dinner. mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food...",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
