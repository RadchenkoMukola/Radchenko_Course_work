"me and my kids got food togo from here because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.cute and attractive diy style decor.friendly staff.i really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).  got a tofu banh mi with a side salad.  when i asked what dressing they had i expected to hear the list of usual uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have.  the first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.my kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).anyhoo.  really pleasantly surprised with this joint and the food was pretty reasonably priced.  as with any place i review i am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.  anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me.  i'de probably really call this 3.5 stars.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
