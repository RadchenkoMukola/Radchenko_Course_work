"i would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp.  it is somewhat hidden among lots of houses and residential buildings.  i ordered a latte and blueberry scone both were great!  i wanted to order food but i was told that they do not serve food (even breakfast) until 11 a.m.  i would go back if i am in the area.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
