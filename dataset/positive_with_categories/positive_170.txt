"i'm new to pittsburgh so i wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you... this spot is definitely worth a try! it's a cute diner with a lot of local charm. the prices are awesome and the food is even better! i had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee. all of it was really good. i'm not a complainer but i'm picky and honestly...i have nothing but good things to say about this place. i highly recommend you stop by and give it a try! you can thank me later. ;)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
