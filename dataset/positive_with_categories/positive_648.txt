"ordered delivery here with coworkers the other evening.i ordered an appetizer or what i thought was an appetizer.  the portion size was amazing that i had some to take home with me to snack on.  i only ordered the bread sticks but they were amazing.  hand made baked and topped with oil and parmesan cheese.  comes with a side of marinara sauce for dipping and i was very pleased.the reason for the three stars was the time it took for delivery.  i believe from the timed the order was called in it took over a hour to have the food show up.  not so good.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
