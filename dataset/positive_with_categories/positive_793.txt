"went there on saturday night following a movie at loews.  we sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their  multiple large flatscreen tvs.   ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadillas.   the calamari was crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark.   it wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey.   the menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented.   gordan ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight.   miller lites are $4 a pop which was a big downer as i got my $85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites.  great atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens game.food looks like its hit or missall in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
