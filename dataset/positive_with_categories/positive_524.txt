"i love n.y. style pizza.  could eat it every day.  on a recent to trip to pittsburgh i tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  one thing about pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true nyc style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  as a rule pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  the sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to nyc pizza.the pizza i tried in pitt in my order of favorites:fiori'spizza sola (penn circle branch)pizza perfecttaaiello's (murray street)beto'ssave for beto's i thought they were all delicious.  wish i had a chance to try mineo's.  a pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed july 5th when i went by their place on murray... i'll try them next time i'm in the 'burgh.pizza perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
