"spectacular byob don't miss it!superb french / mediterranean inspired delicious food that is a adventurous approachable and good value.  the place couldn't be cozier and service is always stellar.  we've been to zinho probably 15 times and the experience is consistent the staff is welcoming the food is top notch. call ahead because there can be a wait and the place is small and intimate and diners enjoy european style eating that is not rushed so plan ahead.  don't forget your favorite bottle (or bottles) of wine and be sure to share a glass with your server.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
