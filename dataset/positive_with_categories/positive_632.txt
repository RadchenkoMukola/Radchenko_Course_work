"cafe zinho was on my list of things to do before leaving pittsburgh.  but who knew it was closed for lunch in may?i eventually came here with my parents (who are not accustomed to non-chinese establishments).  arriving at 5:30 pm we still were able to get a table without any prior reservation.  the host was the owner of the restaurant and gave a personal touch to the service.the decor and environment gave cafe zinho a nice off-the-beaten path look.  gypsy and bohemian.food was superb.  i had the quail but wasn't given the appropriate utensils to eat it.  my mom loved the lamb.  and of course the dessert was fabulous.  since the kitchen is right now nearby you can see the cooks making your meal or dessert.this place only accepts cash although there's an atm nearby.  my mom had a fit because when they bill came they had rounded up with a difference of less than a dollar.  i would give this place 4.5 stars but i rounded up.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
