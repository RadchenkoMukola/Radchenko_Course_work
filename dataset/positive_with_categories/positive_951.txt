"i'm definitely a fan of east end food co-op.  their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store it's definitely worth it.  my favorite part of the co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want!  the same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  the juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than i'm used to but great for a bit of a splurge!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
