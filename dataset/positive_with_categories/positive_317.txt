"i ate here this past sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  i have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  we were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  the rusty nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.for my entree i decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the rusty nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom spinach and feta junior omelet.  her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  it was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  the junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like i was eating healthy.  my omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like i was almost eating a pizza.  some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.the bottom line for me is that i would definitely head back here in the future.  everything that i tasted was good and i would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
