"we had a bigger party and i think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit. they forgot about our waters until the food came out but were super apologetic when they did bring them. the food was ok. i ordered the crab cakes they were a bit heavy on the breading so i would give them a rating of eh. my friend ordered a steak asked for medium rare and it came out...well done. he was too hungry to complain and just ate it. we might go back again and this time maybe take a bit more time looking over the menu.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
