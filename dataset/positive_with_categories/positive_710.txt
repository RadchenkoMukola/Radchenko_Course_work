"haven't been to tgifridays for years and was never really a huge fan. i get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. i must say that i was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. i had the two for $10 lunch special with french onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. i was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so i opted for the french onion. it was okay but i think that i would get a salad instead of the soup next time. the chicken strips were wonderful and i am still craving them. the portion was huge and there were leftovers. my co-workers ordered the jack daniels sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. the service was good and we had no issues. i will definitely be back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
