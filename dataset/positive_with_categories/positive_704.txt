"i heart steak n shake. i love the fact that the fries are shoestring the burgers get to you pretty fast they're a little greasy and the food is super cheap.i visited steak and shake on new year's eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. i was unnaturally attracted to their wisconsin buttery burger which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. sounds good right?well i get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. the pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  i took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and i literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things i had eaten in a long time.this is not meant to be a fine dining experience. service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. it just kind of was. however the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take x amount of time to all patrons. so i give them a pass for being upfront about it.next trip to pgh is going to feature steak and shake - i guarantee it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
