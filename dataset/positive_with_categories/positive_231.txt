"this is the fourth changs i've eat ate. it was pretty good. the food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. had a strange texture. some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. overall still pretty good. would eat at this one again.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
