"pittsburgh's definitely got nothing on seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. tazza d'oro is one of them. i wont say the best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care tazza d'oro subscribes to. it brings them millions of miles above starbucks and (gasp) crazy mocha.i found out about tazza d'oro while browsing the blog of an award winning internationally recognized barista. he conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the us via google maps. i clicked on pa and zoomed it not even expecting to see a marker. surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for tazza d'oro.their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. they also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and at least in my case not done nearly as well as it should be. their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- enrico's in the strip district; what more could you ask for?i have a longer article on tazza d'oro as well as another great coffee shop espresso a mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
