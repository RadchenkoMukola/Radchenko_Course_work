"what a great time!  this place was awesome!  i wish i lived right down the road because i could see myself being a regular here.honestly these guys have got some talent like real talent.  they can play the piano sing play guitar and the drums.  did i mention that they are all pretty hilarious too.  i'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  i am sure i will be back in no time at all.  next time i am bringing a big group of friends.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
