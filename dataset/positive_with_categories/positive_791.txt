"this place hit the spot. stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. we got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. i recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! who knew i liked green beans?! and this trip i tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
