"my wife and i went here around 10pm on a saturday night. the food was not spectacular about the same quality that you'd get at an applebee's or some place similar -- good but not great.  my steak was tough but my wife enjoyed hers. staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar) and had to wait awhile for a server. food was prompt.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
