"i struggle with this review. i wish i could give it a 4 but i really can't hate on it like everyone else. their wait staff has always been super attentive and friendly and their happy hours are great! but a lot of their entrees are a little meh for me especially for the price. stick to happy hour for wine/cheese platters and enjoy a nice summer evening here.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
