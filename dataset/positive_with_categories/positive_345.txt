"i must admit that the first time i went to pino's (about 6 months ago) i was not a fan for several reasons.  however after coming home from brunch the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind but to keep me coming back.my boyfriend had the scallops and i have the pino benedict (eggs benedict of course).  my boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  his eyes were closed he was moaning and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  he said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.my dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.  overall i am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available.  we'll definitely be back for brunch.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
