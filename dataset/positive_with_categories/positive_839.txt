"good food and large portions. i ordered the veggie burger for $8.50 and i loved it! it's one of the most unique veggie burgers i have ever had: a homemade patty of beans rolled oats and veggies. the chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. my burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. as for drinks i'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste i could tell it was very good quality beer. bitter and sweet with a slight tang. i rarely drink beer but i i'm going to then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.note: there aren't too many options for vegetarians. the veggie burger was pretty good and i'd recommend it but other than that there's also the veggie tacos a few select appetizers and a few salads from which to choose.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
