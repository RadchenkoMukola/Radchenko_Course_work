"wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at william penn on tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day buffalo blues for all you can eat wings. there are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings. they bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. i don't think i have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. the only downside to this place is that service is really really slow.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
