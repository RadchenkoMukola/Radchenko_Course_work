"we arrived late in the evening and had to ask our waiter about the pasta festival which he mentioned.  it turned out that both pastas the salad the calamari the cocktails and the service were good.  casbah would have been livelier earlier and more pleasant without a loud and persistent talker in the party of 6 at the next table.  i'd definitely return for the food and service.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
