"the east end food co-op has just about everything you would expect to find in a food co-op except for--sadly--a great selection of local beers.  this tragic fault does not rest with the co-op of course but with the state of pennsylvania.  but you probably don't care because you know where all of these elusive beer distributors are located.so to get back on track i like the local produce focus here and some of the cheeses appeared to be local as well.  nice staff decent prices good little salad bar.  i love co-ops and if you do too then you will love the east end food co-op.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
