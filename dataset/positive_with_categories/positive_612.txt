"i live close by so i go here frequently pretty much for the free wifi and espresso. but here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an americano is so often i am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. there is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from victoria secrets ulta wet seal and the other various shops at this water front location.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
