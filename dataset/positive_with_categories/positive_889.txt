"interesting menu with a lot of things we'd like to go back and try. we started with the zinho salad that i highly recommend.for entrees i had a grouper filet with a cucumber mint sauce and a cous cous. it was a subtle dish but very fresh and tasty. my girlfriend had a chicken dish in a great red pepper sauce. the entrees come with these nicely grilled vegetables -- everything tastes really fresh.the tres leche cake is incredible!great artsy atmosphere with friendly staff. like previous reviewers have said it's eclectic but not over the top and it has a warm and personal vibe. the owners gave us wine. :)",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
