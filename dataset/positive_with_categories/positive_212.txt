"i will admit i am completely biased towards this place. i grew up eating their pizza. crust is soft and fluffy not chewy. the cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place. the sauce has spice but not too much. at some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue. their one downside is that they're not always consistent. some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
