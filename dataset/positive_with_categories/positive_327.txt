"i have been eating at luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). the new location is nice but i miss the coziness of the old place. the food has been consistent through the transition which happened a long while ago by the way. also i have read a few other reviews that said luigi's has left but i talk with him every time i am in. regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and i recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :).",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
