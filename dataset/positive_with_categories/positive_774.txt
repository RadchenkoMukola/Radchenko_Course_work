"very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  we had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. the waitress was very efficient  but not very friendly. our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  try the tilapia milanese  it's excellent. best steamed broccoli iv'e ever had.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
