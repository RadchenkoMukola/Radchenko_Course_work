"my husband and i got here a couple times a year.    always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   i love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken mac and cheese.   recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
