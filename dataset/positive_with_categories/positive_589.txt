"pizza parma has many of the characteristics i like in a pizza joint. 1) they deliver when they say they will 2) diverse menu and toppings 3) coupons 4) online ordering and 5) take credit cards. i think pizza parma shines with their specialty pizzas. artichoke buffalo chicken spinach & feta and greek pies are all delicious. i've also had some of their pasta dishes and i can't complain. it's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge and they come with bread and a salad. pizza parma fails on wings though. the texture is unappealing (aka flappy chicken skin-- yuk!) and the sauces lack depth. desserts are also not worth the buy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
