"can't believe these negative reviewers calling anyone not like them hipsters.  this place is very cool.  as vegan/vegetarians it's not often we can't decide what to order when we go out to eat but this place has tons of great options!  the decor is scattered and mismatched but that's part of the whole re-use and re-purpose idea they are supporting.  the food is more american classic style but there are some unique items as well.  loved the homemade salsa.  best i've had since we visited the atomic eggplant in rochester years ago.  i simply love vegan food and knowing i'm supporting an ethical business.  our server was really helpful and very attentive too.  we'll be back next time we make a trip to the 'burgh!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
