"i adore this place! the light green walls are serene the chairs and tables are comfortable and i love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! the coffee is perfectly smooth and rich which is the most important thing to get right. (i'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) if a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer i'll be a fan for life. the only other pittsburgh place where i've found coffee this delicious was at commonplace coffee in squirrel hill. i went to college near chicago and come from california. i count intelligentsia and blue bottle coffee as some of my favorite places so i mean it when i say the coffee here is wonderful. try it out you won't be let down.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
