"the environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop: tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor. a great place to enjoy a beverage book and music.i had an italian cappuccino. it was well balanced and i enjoyed every sip. on my way out i had a costa rican pour over that took me by surprise. it was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. it rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. as the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.i highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy everything from speaking with competent baristas to the last sip of your drink. i will be returning.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
