"this is literally the first place i went when i first came to pittsburgh - and i loved it. hearty full-sized meals lots to choose from and not too crowded or noisy. although for the sake of full disclosure i didn't sit at the bar and i don't drink alcohol so i can't comment on that. i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. really i have no complaints about this place so i'm surprised by the few low ratings here.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
