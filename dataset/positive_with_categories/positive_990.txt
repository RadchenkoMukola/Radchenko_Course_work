"i may be a little biased... this place is right down the street from my house and we go there frequently but i think blues is great. i have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that i love more than others are the cobb salad and the oscar's garbage burger.      the cobb salad is just a cob salad but some how they make it better than most. i don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing but it is one of the best cobb salads i have ever had.      and the garabge burger....mmmmmmm. this burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. i lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it.  i don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend but kudos to you!but that's not all. imagine a primanti's sandwich but with a big fat burger. it has fries cole slaw an egg and american cheese. my bf often comments it's strange there's no bacon but honestly that'd be over kill. they also have a really good veggie sandwich with hummus (i don't remember the name) a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. also it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and great fresh homemade potato chips. now as far as the ribs and wings go i'm not a big ribs/wings person. i can appreciate that they're good but i wouldn't order it much. having said that my bf frequently orders one or the other and i always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....if you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food i highly suggest it!",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
