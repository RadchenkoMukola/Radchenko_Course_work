"so i moved to pittsburgh from los angeles. i know i know i know!anyway so theres absolutely no places in homestead that delivered chinese so i decided to walk down to the closest chinese food/restaurant to my house. the family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. i read a review about them on google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. don't believe it!on this visit i ordered the steamed dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...that liar) and the vegetable chow fun. i generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and i'll force myself to eat them when i have the munchies/starving to death. the vegetable chow fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy. definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by. but all in all the verdict is you typical chinese take out place.*puts the menu on the fridge*",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
