"this is a good co-op for pittsburgh stocking up on local items and friendly staff. however i was surprised at the teeny tiny amount of fresh food. my normal experience with co-ops includes massive amounts of produce dairy baked goods and meats. not here though; instead it's like a co-op in miniature. even the mozzarella i was looking for came only in tiny olive-sized balls. don't get me wrong - i fully support the existence of a co-op especially in an area like the east end but to be honest i think a trip to the strip district would be much more productive shopping-wise.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
