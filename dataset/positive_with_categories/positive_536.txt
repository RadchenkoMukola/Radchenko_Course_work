"great menu - lots of choices. there were six of us and we shared 3 appetizers - the grilled chickpea hummus the grilled octopus and the mixed olives. the babagonoush hummus was delicious i had a winter fizz drink which was prosecco  with cranberry and mint nice flavor and perfect before dinner drink i had the cioppiano which was one of the best meals i have had in a long time. the sour dough bread was soooooo good. most everyone else ordered pasta dishes and thought them very good. we opted not to have dessert there but they did bring salted carmels to the table with the check so if they were any prediction of the desserts they are excellent. great place to dine - i will return. and the complimentary valet parking was nice as well - didn't have to search for a place to park and the valet were super nice. i should mention our waitress was also super nice and very accomodating to our larger party.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
