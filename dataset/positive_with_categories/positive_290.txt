"this is such a fabulous place.  regardless of the occasion the food and the service are impeccable.  in pittsburgh trying to find a restaurant that will fit everyone in your parties needs is difficult - casbah is the spot.  my family had a birthday party for me here on sunday.  casbah was accommodating with a cake with a loud bunch that constantly changed their order and were extremely patient.  the food was outstanding as per usual! i ordered the elysian lamb which was delicious! cannot wait to return!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
