"rock the casbah! rock the casbah! a group of us went to the casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  it has been ages since i've been to the casbah and since i live clear across the country i was looking forward to going back.  all of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the jumbo lump crab chopped salad or the wild mushroom and goat cheese omelet.  both were nice portions. i was fixated on the orecchiette pasta grilled chicken dried cranberries capriole goat cheese sage cream and it was a home run!  (i wasn't watching calories that day!)  service was excellent . . . surprisingly so especially with a table of eleven a bunch of sallies and one harry if you know what i mean.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
