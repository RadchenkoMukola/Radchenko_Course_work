"overall a good experience. food was mostly very good. my sweet pea risotto was just ok. my wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. neither of us are big eaters but noted how small the portions were especially compared to the price. one cup of risotto for $20+? four ravioli for the same?they altered the desert recipe on request which for sure was over and above the call.service was attentive and the setting nice.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
