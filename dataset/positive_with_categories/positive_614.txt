"i go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer so i was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  my maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  my moh and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  my shower was wonderful the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  it started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  the only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  there was salmon chicken potatoes and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  it would have just gone to waste!also not at all related to the shower their trivia night is super fun!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
