"this use to be my go to panera bread.  when i worked in the area i would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.  i was happy when i left the area and moved on to bigger and better things.  my waist also appreciated it.  those scones are delicious.i recently stopped back here when i was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  with all my new allergies i came in here hoping to get some bread.  not knowing nor doing my homework before i showed up i asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  not knowing the answer herself she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes ingredients included.  after looking through it for a few minutes i was able to select the bread i wanted.  they will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  if you would rather slice yourself i am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  yes it's true it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.  but it is much better tasting.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
