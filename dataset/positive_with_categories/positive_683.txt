"everyone i show this place to loves it. yes it's totally hipster and funky. yes hipster service isn't going to walk up to you all bubbly and smiley and be super cheesy to you. but the employees are chill and it's all about the food milkshakes and coffee. the rotating menu is awesome and i've tried a lot and never gotten anything bad. the chai milkshakes are amazing as are all of their drinks. i'm not even a vegetarian and this one of my favorite places to go over and over!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
