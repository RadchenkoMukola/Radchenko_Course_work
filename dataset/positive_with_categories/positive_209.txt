"i was impressed.  went here for lunch.  the seafood gumbo was tremendous.  i wasn't in the mood for more seafood so i had the chicken blt on ciabatta bread.  i'm not sure what type of creamy sauce they put on the bread but it was delicious.  will go back again.the food was reasonably priced for lunch.  dinner would obviously be more expensive but i imagine it's worth the $.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
