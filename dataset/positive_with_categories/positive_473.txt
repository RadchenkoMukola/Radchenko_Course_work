"i ate here for brunch on sunday.  it's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  it included a mimosa/bloody mary appetizer and main plate.  i had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  all was great.  they could have had some more flavorful cheeses but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  the bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  i will definitely be returning for brunch!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
