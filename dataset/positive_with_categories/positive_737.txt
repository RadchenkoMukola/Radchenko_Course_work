"luigis is the best of the best. awesome authentic pepperoni. i have eaten here for years. this place is a tradition in my family and it's still as good as they were 15 years ago. they recently remodeled and have a great menu selection. by far the best pizza in bellevue and right up there with fioris as the best in pittsburgh.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
