"went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  we ordered a few appetizers first.  the wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  had a burger you can create your own from veggie turkey or fresh ground beef. had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.the brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
