"i've eaten at casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite helpful recommendations and my glass is never empty. i continue to think that the piccola gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options but i would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel so good they're worth a star all by themselves.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
