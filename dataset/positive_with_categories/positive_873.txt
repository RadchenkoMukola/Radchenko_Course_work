"i love you quiet storm!!  please open another location in the los angeles area stat.  i think the best part about quiet storm was rolling in at 10:30 on a sunday and being seated without a wait.  are you kidding me?  that's amazing!  i was prepared to have to wait for a little bit for sunday brunch. quiet storm has quite possibly the most delicious scrambled tofu that i have ever had.  i have no idea what they do to get the tofu to that texture but its delightful and don't ever change.  i love animal products but i did not miss the meat in any of the dishes that i sampled.  i order the black & gold breakfast burrito which was delicious but not half as excited at the country gravy burrito my friend had.  the onion gravy is insanely flavorful and made me question why i put animal in my gravy to begin with.  i know its a crazy thought but its true.  i look forward to many additional trips during my extended stay in pittsburgh.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
