"this is a great stop for fresh everything! i crave their juice on a regular basis. shot of kale yes! the salad bar and hot foods bar are also great hot foods change on a regular basis but always have vegan/veg options. aside from a quick dinner/grocery shopping location we tried their weekend brunch. my bf loved everything and the prices were great for a full plate of food. i myself devoured some vegan pumpkin bread and a delicious fair-trade coffee. i also love their to-go foods selection full of vegan-friendly wraps salads and more - great for picnics! the staff is very friendly and it's obvious they like their jobs. the bulk foods and produce sections are also impressive! i wish it was closer but it's worth the commute!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
