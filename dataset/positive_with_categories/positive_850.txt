"we go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. it's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). my bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  homefries with tofu instead of eggs. the waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. this establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet you may find yourself disappointed.on cold wintery days try a mexican hot chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
