"this is definitely one of the most interesting places i've been to in a good way. casbah is a great local place that serves smaller (but admittedly pricey) portions and they change their menu up frequently to match the ingredients available to them each season.the set-up is...different? i couldn't quite figure out what was going on with it; you basically walk into a door and enter what looks like what was once a courtyard which was covered with a canvas - maybe they take this down during the summer? possibly? i'm not sure; anyway if you walk to the back of the courtyard you'll get into the actual bar.the menu here at least during my visit was delicious - fantastic fresh sangria a very interesting but tasty bruschetta (that rather than going with the traditional tomatoes and basil was covered in a kind of cream cheese greens and nuts) and a reasonably portioned bowl of pasta with sausage and spinach. not complaints other than the fact that the pasta was a bit spicy and i wasn't warned about this. it wasn't too strong though.our waitress was doing the best that she could (i think) but was a little slow. still the place was fairly busy and i had good company to talk to during my meal so no hard feelings on that one.i say give this place a try if you have the money to spare - and even then get a coupon or a groupon; i went with someone who was using a birthday gift card and it helped the pricing tremendously.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
