"i've said it before and i'll say it again i love me a buffet.an excellent price for some good food never hurts.  all the usual chinese fare is on the buffet with that american flare added for some spice...i suppose it would be to spice it up...  anyway  i got to taste all my favorite chinese foods from general tso's to cheese won tons.  just in case i didn't want to overdose on chinese i decided to try some of the mac n' cheese and fried potatoes (although i admit i added sweet and sour sauce to the potatoes).  servers are around often to pick up the plates you are finished with and to make sure your glasses are refilled.  atmosphere is somewhat comfortable.  appears to me they tried to squeeze in more seating than they could.  i would have given five stars but as my friend pointed out while we were there our waters tasted like it came from a hose you may have used to fill up your backyard pool.  next time i'll go with the soda i suppose.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
