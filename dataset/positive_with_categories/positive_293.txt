"the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in pittsburgh is also my neighborhood watering hole--i'm so fortunate. the food is great (especially love the ginger sunflower dish and spicy peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. you have to appreciate what they can do without meat or other animal products. the drinks are amazing.the hipster atmosphere reminds me of portlandia. staff is friendly. gets busy at brunch time on the weekends.quiet storm gets 4 for its food 5 for cool factor and 5 overall.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
