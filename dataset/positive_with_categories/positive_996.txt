"nothing special. just like applebee's chili's or fridays. stick to the bar food (burgers sandwiches pizza wings and salads) and you will be okay. this was our second attempt at trying rock bottom on fathers day. the first time almost ten years ago. we went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. how do you do that on fathers day?! this time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.my wife got and loved the berry bash sangria. she just said it had too much ice in it. our daughter got the root beer float which she love and i started with a mango ice tea but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.we started off the the kobe beef sliders as our app. it took at least 15 minutes to get them. you get three sliders and they were very good.my wife got a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. she complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.our daughter got the kids burger and fries. no surprise there.i ordered the new york strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. my strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. longhorn has a much much better quality of steak though. the green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. the kitchen sounded like an live episode of hell's kitchen. the waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. the kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.on a different note our waitress susan was very good. come here for drinks and the bar food. skip everything else.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
