"a ok!really loved the bacon wrapped shrimp! so amazing with the sauce on the side. this was probably the the best part of the meal.  i also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch. the spinach was just steamed without any flavoring... which is better in the long run  but i wish they had options for sauteed with garlic. the service was great as well!  we were always taken care of.  will definitely bring my bf here in the future.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
