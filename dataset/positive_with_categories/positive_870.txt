"very few people name the places depending on how the place is going to look like from the city's perspective.confused??i bet half of pittsburgh students didn't notice this amazing vegan placeit is like a quiet storm ;just there but not really.now i am confused!! :)  straight to the point -this place is huge and neat and they have a huge cafe bar with great food list.i ordered thai salad with vegan chicken and tempeh and my friends ordered wraps.it was simply delicious and i was extremely excited that i discovered this place after a long vegan research. the place was definitely quiet and shockingly even the area around the place was dead.maybe they have some historical reasons to name it quiet storm like there was a light storm and everyone left the place...ahmm..i shall stop my list of lame reasonssuch that you could stop reading and would be able to chase the quiet storm :)-smriti",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
