"this co-op is probably great for vegans and vegetarians but i am paleo.  i was very happy to find grassfed butter raw milk and cheese at reasonable prices.  the bulk foods section was missing a few mainstay items i typically pick up and the meat selection was very poor.  i would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.for my future needs i will be ordering directly from the farm (this co-op sells items from the farm that i will be direct ordering from) at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
