"this might be the best food i've had in pittsburgh.the restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. the hostess stand is located in the indoor space. we were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. this is the only negative point i have about the meal.we ordered the cheese  tasting menu the duck the scallop pasta and the lemon sponge cake. each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. the waiter was friendly and knowledgable. we left feeling full and happy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
