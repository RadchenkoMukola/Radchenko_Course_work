"i have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look.  i thought it might be a red lobster knock off.  then i asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had and liked it.i was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside.  very cozy.  much more upscale than i had thought it would be.  the service was terrific.  lots of things to choose from on the menu.  a bit pricier than i had imagined.  most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  but this is pittsburgh and this is seafood.that said they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  butter was soft which i like.  our entrees came pretty quickly.  i had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  the scallops were just done i like them cooked a little more.  everything else was pretty good.my beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.we'll probably be back but will order something different.   we liked it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
