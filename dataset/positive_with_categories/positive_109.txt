"this has been my favorite restaurant for several years and the one we go to the most often. my partner says they make the best scallops in pgh. i'll never forget the stuffed zucchini blossoms: lovely! monique is a gracious hostess. the restaurant used to be a garage -- check out the ceiling. love it when they open the wall in the summer. cash only. byob. just off ellsworth. don't know if they treat everyone like family but that's how they treat us. highly recommended.(10/20/13 although the food stayed consistently good it's not quite the same now that hostess monique is gone.)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
