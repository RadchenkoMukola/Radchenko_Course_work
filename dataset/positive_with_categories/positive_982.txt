"cute little spot in a sweet neighborhood. snag a table before ordering and you'll have a great experience. i stopped in for a cappuccino and sandwich. the cappuccino was hot and satisfying (good quality beans strong). and the vegetable panini adequate (i'm not the biggest fan of artichoke leaves).good spot for reading a book and eavesdropping on strangers' conversations.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
