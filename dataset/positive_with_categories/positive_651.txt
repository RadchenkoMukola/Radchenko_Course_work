"went to rock bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. my coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. the waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. if you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from chili's - the filling tasted like that and i am a big fan! mondays are half off burger days and i tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos pepper jack cheese pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. it was delish! the ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. the prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday it's totally worth it. i think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. i felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. the service was quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
