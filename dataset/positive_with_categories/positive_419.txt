"food: 2 stars. it's really not very good. especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. blue cheese wasn't bad though. my wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. nice and fresh though. drinks: 3 stars for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.service: 3 stars. could have been better could have been worse. friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (hint: if one person calls you over for a drink make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) atmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. 1 bonus star for accommodating the pittsburgh area buffalo bills fans! go bills!!!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
