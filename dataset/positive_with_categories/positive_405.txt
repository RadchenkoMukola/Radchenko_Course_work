"food was great--- vegetarian burrito stuffed with mac and cheese???? yes please.  also had a great pot of tea and a bangin' white chocolate hazelnut banana milkshake.  it's a really cute place too.however the owner was seriously rude to me and my fellow guests when we asked to split a check (which they state on the menu is allowed).  not even passive aggressive- straight up aggressive for something that was not our fault.  so that was a sour end to my experience at quiet storm. but my belly was satisfied.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
