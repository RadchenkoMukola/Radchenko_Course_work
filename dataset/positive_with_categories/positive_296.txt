"this is some of the best coffee i've ever had. i've been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didn't have irritating quirks in their service (i've run into a cash-only lame hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop which are useless to me.)the pastry i had was good though a bit overpriced at ~$3. the mocha i had was absolutely amazing though their largest size is only 16 oz which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
