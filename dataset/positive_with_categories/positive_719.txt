"this is one of the true sleepers of neighborhood pittsburgh. since 1979 this diner/family restaurant has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. the staff has been there as long.they have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. they also have my favorite pancakes. if you're looking for a cheap low key dependable place to go come home at 8 o'clock one evening sit in the window and especially around the holiday season i assure you that it will be one of the best old time meals you'll ever have. i hate its name but i love the rusty nail.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
