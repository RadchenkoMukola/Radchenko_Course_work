"the food at cafe zinho is fun creative and always spot on delicious.  while the menu changes often one of my favorites has always been the lamburger cooked to perfection!  deserts by becky are always excellent.  and who would have thought such excellent food would be served out of a redecorated garage?  (it's lovely in the summer when they open the garage door.) the ambiance can be described as funky and eclectic and actually quite lovely.  it's a byob which is great if you want to save a buck or have a great bottle of wine in your cellar.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
