"although i wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here this is a resturant that i enjoy having a meal at when i am in the homestead water front. on all of my visits here i have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. the dipping sauce are to die for.  i've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp and the accompanying sauces. the first time i ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. so this resturant has sentimental value to me. i attach eating here to having a special night out in the waterfront. bar louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food that is.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
