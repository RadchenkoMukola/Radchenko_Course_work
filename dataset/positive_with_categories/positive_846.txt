"another great big burrito restaurant casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great and varied dining rooms.the three dinning rooms outside inside and downstairs.  while downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there it is beautiful and quiet.  perfect for a larger group of people.  outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.the food is mediterranean fusion not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. the hummus here was actually the first hummus that i had ever had and i am sorry to say it is what i compare all other to few match up.the wine list is extensive but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place for that you'll want to go down the road to soba.  if you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation casbah is it.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
