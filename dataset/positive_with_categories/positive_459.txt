"my cousin took me here for my birthday it's in a bad neighborhood almost a war zone but the food is out of this world. we sat down to a bowl of garbanzo bean salad done simply with herbs spices and olive oil simple but delicious! a basket of bread soon arrived with an olive oil dipping bowl. we split the half pound meatball that was only second to mom's great meatballs. salad was good after the appetizer i had the home made blue cheese dressing. the pasta course was rotini with vodka sauce best vodka sauce i've ever had. the main course was amazing i had the pork cutlet parmesan. the pork melted in your mouth the sauce was excellent the cheese had a sharp bite and a drizzle of truffle oil made it all come together. be prepared to sit for two hours for the entire meal. large tvs in the upstairs dining room show the godfather movies without the sound we were surprised the pretty gruesome scenes were shown while trying to eat. great place the bill was close to a buck and a half. it's pricey but worth the splurge.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
