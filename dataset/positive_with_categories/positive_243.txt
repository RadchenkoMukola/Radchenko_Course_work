"excellent place for brunch.  for $22 i had a mimosa; cheese fruit and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin scone and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  reservations available through open table.  this is definitely a special occasion brunch but it is surprisingly affordable.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
