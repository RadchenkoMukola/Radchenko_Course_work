"i had some pizza from pizza parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  a colleague brought it in so i didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  i had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  nothing special nothing especially good or bad.  crust sauce cheese pepperoni fin.  it was a little greasy and quite cheesy as well.  i was starving so i really enjoyed it but i think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  still for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner i'd say go for it.  just don't have very high expectations.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
