"visiting from ny we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! it's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  the ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm friendly and attentive. we were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. a real vip treatment.  for starters the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. many of the others sounded great too.  our daughter who is at college here was missing some of the food options of ny. not any more. she had the lamb burger with feta cheese. i had the seafood stew and my wife had chilean sea bass.  all fantastic! thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. if anyone knows of a portuguese restaurant this good in nyc ... or even in newark ironbound i'd love to hear about it.  we will definitely be back!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
