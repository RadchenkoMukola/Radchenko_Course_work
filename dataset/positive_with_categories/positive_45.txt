"stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere. in hindsight we wish we had stayed here. :-)we had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation. i hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually have...a meal. i like this funkier part of town.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
