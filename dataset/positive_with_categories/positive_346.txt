"first time here tonight and i must say i wasn't sure if i wanted to go. it seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but i decided to go with friends and man did i have a blast. the $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). the food was not super but good prices reasonable. the beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. i asked for something similar to yeungling but what i got was nothing like it. the musicians were great they made this place awesome. we will b back and this may b our new pittsburgh hangout",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
