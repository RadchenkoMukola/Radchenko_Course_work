"i am shocked to see this place isn't five stars. we order delivery from here at least once a week. their lunch specials are great and the portions are always always plentiful. i've never waited more than 25 minutes even though they always say 45. i think it's respectful just in case they run behind. i will say that if you are looking for a truly authentic chinese meal this probably isn't your best option (although way more authentic than house of lee. yuck!) both my boyfriend and i think it is plenty authentic for us always delicious. i have cravings for their eggrolls daily he loves their wonton soup. it is the only kind of soup i will eat it's that good. and we love the cute little chinese guy that usually delivers our food. my bf and i always get the biggest smiles on our faces when we hear our apt buzz with  china seeaaa!! =)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
