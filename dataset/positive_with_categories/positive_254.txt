"i live in connecticut and visit family in pittsburgh often. pino's is my favorite pittsburgh restaurant. i don't have one favorite dish because i usually order one of the specials which change often. i ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. the bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (i think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what i had in italy. my son had the seafood risotto. it was so good i need to order it next time.my brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. he loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). he was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.oh they also make great cocktails and have a very very nice wine list.oh if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the belgium place around the corner try pino's. the fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!no it isn't cheap. but i'm happy to pay for quality.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
