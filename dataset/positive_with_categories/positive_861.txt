"first off i have to note their maine lobster bisque is amazing. definately don't miss out on it. that being said we had lunch there and the lunch portions are a good value. i had the cedar plank salmon. the fish was fantastic except that the vegetables were a little bland. the atmosphere at the restaurant is quite relaxed and i don't think i've ever seen it get more than mildly busy in there so it is a nice place to go to have a quiet meal with someone special.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
