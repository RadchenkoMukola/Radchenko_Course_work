"i have had lunch at pinos's several times probably at least 5 times. usually i am there  for a business lunch when i am in the area. i find that we are well served not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch we have several times asked the chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. to me this is excellent service. makes you feel like coming back.i would have to admit that i usually order the garlic fries which are really great. i do this if i am not going back to the office or out to meet a client.normally i would add a soup of the day which are always nice and a sandwich of the day. i have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here. pino's has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects.  i would make it 3 1/2 stars.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
