"the service started out slow but they eventually picked up the pace. we ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer and we enjoyed it. for the entres we had the fried rice and mongolian beef both of which were delightful. i would not mind going back to explore their menu.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
