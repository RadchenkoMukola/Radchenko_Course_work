"on our way back from dc to chicago yesterday we stopped off here since my friend swore by it. one of the best co-ops i have ever been to. they have such a huge selection of products. if you are looking for vegan cheese this place has a humongous selection including sheese which my bud says is really hard to find. they carry my beloved temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. nummers! i grabbed delicious produce a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by najat's cuisine a still warm ginger cookie made there a raspberry ginger beer and i'm sure i am forgetting something. i would come here all the time if i lived in pittsburgh. their hot food looked good but i wanted something to grab and go.funny thing in the time that we were there three people commented that they really liked my tattoos. then the cashier said he liked my obama button. i love this place!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
