"my experience has been ok at the quiet storm because i have 1) not deviated much from my usual menu choice (original home fries = delicious) and 2) i have often known several members of the wait staff at any given time.this has given me reason to continue eating at quiet storm on occasion.negatives... i have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions not enough seasonings could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods etc). service can be a little slow at times. and i have been burned a few times when going out of my way (it is a little off the beaten path for many) to score some delicious home fries only to find that the qs had inexplicably closed early.despite this for pittsburgh the qs is a good spot for vegan/vegetarian fare.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
