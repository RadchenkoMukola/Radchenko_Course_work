"tasty option for sunday brunch i've read the reviews and what seems to ring true is that pino's has a good sunday brunch. thankfully that's when me and my gang decided to check out this little lovely! brunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some italian twists. my mum had challah french toast and loved it. pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top - i tried that and it had a nice kick to it.other folks at the table had the eggs benedict salad and sammy. over all everyone was happy and it was only half full so easy to talk and hang out. and for the music complainer (you whining stinker) we had a nice ipod mix on when we were there!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
