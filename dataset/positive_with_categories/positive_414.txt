"this is my second review of alla famalgia and again this place gets five stars. i loved every part of my meal. i started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. the waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. there i chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. explaining as he went on first slicing fresh chantrel portobellos and button mushrooms. next he saut√© them in olive oil added brown sugar brandy raisins and finished it with heavy cream. they were fantastic. there were a variety of specials including wild boar chops a risotto with prawns scallops and black truffles. but i chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. it was the best piece of filet i've ever had. it was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. i could barely touch it after the pasta salad bread and appetizers. i brought my leftovers home and have them another time. dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. it was a nice take on an old favorite. for the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
