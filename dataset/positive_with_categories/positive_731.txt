"the coffee here was excellent! had a double espresso. apparently their roaster is in santa cruz ca. large selection of french press coffees. baked goods did not look too great but that is not why i came here. atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. also has wifi which works! nice to find a place like this when traveling. is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
