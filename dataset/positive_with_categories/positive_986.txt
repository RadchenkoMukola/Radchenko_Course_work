"though i didn't get a chance to visit this place when i visited last month i really do love quiet storm and i will be sure i hit it up next time i'm in town visiting my friends there. the decor is adorable. the prices are reasonable. it was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. i really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart pittsburgh. it's truly a unique space.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
