"just moved here from baltimore and ran across this place.  love it!  watch yourself at the hot bar.  there's no scale (should be).  your mea l(of veggies tofu and kale) could end up costing $20 easily.  i usually grab a hot meal and play on my computer 1-2 hours.  love the carrott juice with ginger yum!  a small is $4.30 ouch!  just found out they won't charge you for bags if you bring your own....cool!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
