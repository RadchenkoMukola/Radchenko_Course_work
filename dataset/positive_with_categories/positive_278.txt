"this is a quiet little nook in highland park that is perfect for tea coffee snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. i used to frequent this place much more when i lived in pittsburgh but i still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. it is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  the staff is great and the prices are reasonable too. the only change i could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. it'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
