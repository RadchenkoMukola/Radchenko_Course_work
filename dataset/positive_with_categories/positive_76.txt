"cafe zinho is a quaint little spot tucked away in the hidden corners of shadyside.i have driven by it many times without even realizing it was a restaurant. thankfully my more knowledgeable girlfriend recommended checking it out as she had to buy me dinner. cruel world i know.we were able to get an early reservation on a saturday pick up a bottle of wine ( a must!) and make it relatively on time. intimate is precisely the word i would use to describe this living room dining experience. the waitresses are what you would want your host mom to be like from a foreign country and splendidly cheery.we ordered two apps both delicious. they also served some impeccable cornbread as well. the first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese that was worthy of plate licking had it been socially acceptable. the second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). most of the time when i order clams they are far too fishy but these were perfect.the lady friend ordered the special a quail dish while i ordered lamb osobuco. the portions were very generous and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. i must say the quail was divine. i ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so i could switch plates while she was distracted. it was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices the meat juicy and rich. the lamb was textured and cooked very well however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself. perhaps more garlic or such.either way i will return maybe with some portuguese phrases in hand to banter with my adopted foreign mom/waitress.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
