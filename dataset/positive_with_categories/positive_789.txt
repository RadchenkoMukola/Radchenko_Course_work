"i will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  we got seated quickly with a reservation.  our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  he was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  the manager was also great.  we weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  i will say this - they know how to treat their customers. we'll definitely be back :)",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
