"i moved to pittsburgh for the tempeh reuben at quiet storm.  actually i'm lying.  or maybe not.  am i trying to save face because i don't want to admit that i moved across the country for a sandwich?  you'll never know because i'm not telling.anyway the food here is pretty good.  sometimes it's better than others though i think it depends on the cooks.  i'm one of those vegetarians who doesn't much care about reducing kilocalories (the point of eating is to fuel our bodies right?) so i like the cooks who pile on the mayo and cheese.  i'm sure the cooks who skimp on fattening ingredients have their fan base too.  the menu is creative and it feels like the people who make the food are trying to test their cooking chops which i appreciate.  the atmosphere is nice here: big open space yet cozy.  and you won't find a radder floor in pittsburgh.  the employees are super nice.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
