"out of the big burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. and this is just not a one time bad experience i have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.service has always been good and attentive i enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or i expected much better for the money i am paying. for example:sumac scallop appetizer cooked perfectly but the tartness of the sumac was not there the other thing is i can brown a scallop at home in a restaurant i am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it almost crunchy top juicy center. also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush 1 tsp come on eggplant is that expensive.risotto - over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.duck entrée again duck was perfectly cooked quince jus was nice not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. i even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.pasta entrée with spinach this could have been good but spinach was not washed and had grit in it this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.if this was some little bistro where i was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) i wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money i expect a little more attention to detail.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
