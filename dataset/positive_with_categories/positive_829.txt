"i don't know of any place that comes to close to the quality of mediterranean food offered at casbah.  they have a daily menu that combines unique ingredients into a great blend.  my favorites on their menu are their spinach casareccia (which i customize with tuna steak instead of chicken) and their gnocchi (in that order).  they are open to customizing their menu so if you want half and half of each dish they are happy to do that for you.  that is a huge plus for me.  they are safely my favorite big burrito restaurant",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
