"the tuna was enjoyable and the service was prompt. the house chardonnay was buttery and was a good compliment to the fish. it was a tuesday night so the place was busy but not crowded. since i wasn't wowed by the place i won't give it 5 stars but i had no dissatisfaction to speak of. i will be back (if i'm not across the street at the rock bottom brewery).",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
