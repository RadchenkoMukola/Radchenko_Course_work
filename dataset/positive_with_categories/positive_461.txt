"i had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  the individual size was smaller than i expected for $12 but i wasn't starving so it was very filling.  our waitress april was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  we had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  i can't wait to try it again!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
