"living down the street of buffalo blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.  the huge beer selection means there is something for everyone.  for any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings which are decently priced and good.the bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  it's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  but while they have a good number of hd tvs only two are broadcast in hd so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
