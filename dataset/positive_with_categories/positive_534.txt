"one of my favorite restaurants in the world.  excellent atmosphere fantastic food great wine/drinks.  menu changes up pretty regularly and i've never had a bad dish there.  the stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. the scallops were also fantastic. the front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps.revision: i was just back at casbah for a fundraising dinner.  once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  all proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.my dinner was so good i literally almost cried.  the wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things i've ever eaten in my life.  short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing i ate that evening but i found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  i had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  the cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  it was amazing!while i don't believe these are regular menu items i highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  that they made no money off of.  an area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in pittsburgh.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
