"this is my 2nd time here and i thought that i attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact i was sooooo hungry. well my 2nd time and for a chinese buffet this place is fantastic. the restaurant itself is very clean. the buffet is also very clean and even though i showed up within an hour of closing they were still bringing out fresh entrees. the amount of choice is less than just about all the chinese buffets that i have ever been too but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. all the patrons here are american so this isn't the asian place where the asians eat. it's very non-spicy non-original food but it's fresh and good tasting. i would certainly return. giving it 7.5 knuckles out of 11.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
