"organic vegan vegetarian juice bar and much more.  this place is friggin heaven.  when i made the initial switch to vegetarian a few years ago i struggled.  not from the desire but from a lack of options.  then i found the co-op. in my opinion the co-op is just as valuable as public libraries!!!",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
