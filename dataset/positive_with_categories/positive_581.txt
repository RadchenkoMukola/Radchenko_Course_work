"i love mitchell's fish market.  95% of the time the food is amazing but when they mess up they move heaven and earth to make it better.  the last time we were at mitchell's i ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  my lobster was underdone.  the server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though i had eaten most of it.  then to make our night even better comped us a dessert.  it's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
