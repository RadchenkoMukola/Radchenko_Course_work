"i usually have fair experiences with this pf changs. i've been inside the restaurant and have used the curbside to go service. i finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience.i can't remember her name but whomever worked curbside to go on oct 30 2013 around 6:30pm deserves a mention. she was very nice and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. they're usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! she also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones) but these were very good. the food here is always in point. i like to get the edamame sesame chicken with brown rice and the flour less chocolate dome! i'm reducing a star because of past experiences with service.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
