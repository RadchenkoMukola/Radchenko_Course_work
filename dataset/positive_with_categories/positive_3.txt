"i personally enjoyed my recent visit to bar louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. the restaurant is pricey for what it is and our waitress was a bit lackluster.so why does bar louie get 3 stars? happy hour and a nice patio!happy hour is on monday-friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 drafts $4 wines $5 martinis and 1/2 price select appetizers and flatbreads. my friend and i ordered 4 martinis and 3 appetizers between the 2 of us and our bill was less than $40 total. not bad!i ordered a strawberry peach bellini and a s'mores martini and both were tasty. we shared bruschetta pomodoro spinach & artichoke dip and roasted vegetable flatbread. the food was also good and i would order all three items again in the future.my recommendation is to understand what bar louie is good at (happy hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
