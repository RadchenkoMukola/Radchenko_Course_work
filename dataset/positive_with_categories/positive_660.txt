"after three trips to quiet storm i am hooked.   i had the bahn mi then the veggie gyro then a burrito.  all were a large portion with excellent fresh ingredients at a price that was really really great.  my significant other is addicted to the chili which actually has a good heat level.  also the milkshakes are to die for.  can't get enough of them.service is prompt and attentive.  the waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly.  service is quick even when they are busy.  this is the perfect casual restaurant.  the decor is funky  and cool.  there is even a pinball machine!will return again and again i am sure.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
