"the co-op is great!  when we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy we were lost -- until we found the east end food co-op. that was 10 years ago and i've shopped there weekly ever since. it provides for all of our gluten-free dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. i also love buying grains beans etc. from the bulk bins fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals nut butters snacks etc. they now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in vegan options. also have to mention the awesome produce section stocked mostly from local farms.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
