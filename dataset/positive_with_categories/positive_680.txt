"while visiting relatives in somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of homestead.  my aunt insisted that we have lunch at uno's pizzeria & grill as the food was delicious.  when we arrived i had to admit that i was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  it was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  i settled on a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  they have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  the food arrived in no time and was delicious!  the portions were just right for lunch i was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  the four of us had items off the two for u lunch menu our bill was less than $30 which meant that i might could afford the shoes i wanted to buy!  my aunt was right you cannot visit homestead without stopping to eat at uno pizzeria & grill it is fantastic!!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
