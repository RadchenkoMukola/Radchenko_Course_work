"so i have never been to p.f. chang's before since i'm chinese and i'm not a huge fan of eating at chinese/american restaurants when i can eat delicious authentic chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). my boyfriend and i were at dave & busters and weren't in the mood for american food which was what we were all surrounded by so i decided to give p.f. chang's a try. we came on a saturday night without reservations so we had to wait 45min :( luckily time went by fast while i was on my phone looking at the yelp reviews for this place. when we were seated we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. we got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the dan dan noodles and shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. the food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. the calamari was okay. i felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. the dan dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. i really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. the shrimp was cooked well and was also good. overall i was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if i'm ever in the mood for chinese/american food.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
