"i'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. their nachos is pretty good. i also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. i think the only thing i did't like is the steak taco appetizer. it was too sour and kinda tasteless.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
