"the east end food co-op has become my favorite place to get groceries. i've recently changed to eating vegan and this place has everything i need. the bulk food section is awesome from all types of organic flour to organic candy granola rice pasta teas coffee even bulk tamari. you can bring your own container and fill it up. if not bags and containers are available. all different types of vegan (as well as some non-vegan) canned goods soymilks vegan cheeses and meat substitutes are available. there is so much crammed into the place sometimes its hard to find what you need but staff is very friendly and are always there to help. it doesn't have the glitz and glam of whole foods but the prices are a little better. if you become a member once a month you can purchase items at a pretty good discount.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
