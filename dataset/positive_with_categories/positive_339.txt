"there are restaurants that are special because of the food and there are restaurants that are special because of the service.  café zinho is everything.the proprietor of zinho is one of the nicest gents in the business as far as i'm concerned.  i know this because i had occasion to collaborate with him on a few events 10 years ago.  so while i may be a bit biased 10 years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  my point is if you're one of those people that enjoys patronizing establishments run by nice people zinho fits the bill.  we arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and i immediately fell in love with the place. nestled along the homey part of ellsworth avenue zinho exudes a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  our server ramon was wonderful and made thoughtful recommendations for each course.  i selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entrée.  neither disappointed. the salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness and the crab cakes were stuffed not with filler but succulent crab.  while i'd get the crab cakes again next time i'm in for the lamb since one bite of jonathan d's dish had me hooked so hard i practically baaa'ed (poor lamb).  at $180 for four people it isn't the cheapest option in the 'burgh but by no means is it the most expensive. and it's byob so bring a bottle and enjoy the wonderfulness that is café zinho.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
