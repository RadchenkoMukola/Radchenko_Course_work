"lovely relaxing atmosphere. the cauliflower soup with tarragon emulsion was fabulous as was the tomato basil soup. the waiter was attentive and happily allowed for a substitution on my salad so i could try one of the raw milk cheeses from their cheese sampler. the grilled chicken breast on my salad was a bit more dry and hard than i like but i am not a big fan of barbecuing chicken and it certainly seemed to have been charred that way. if the chicken had been moist this place would get all five stars from me!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
