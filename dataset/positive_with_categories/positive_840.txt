"this place has great seafood. the best in the area. i come here for seafood every time. everything on their menu is good. their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters.  their clam chowder is the best. really creamy with lots of clams. wonderful restaurant. you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. we love coming to this restaurant. don't forget a reservation on weekends. you will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. we never get to the dessert. always too full to eat dessert.   forgot to take pictures.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
