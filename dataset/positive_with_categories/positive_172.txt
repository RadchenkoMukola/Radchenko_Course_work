"ordered the lunch special with sesame bean curd + steamed rice + veggie egg roll.  the food was great and you get a lot for $5.65.  my friend got general tso's chicken with fried rice and she enjoyed her meal as well.the lady at the counter was very friendly and refilled our waters often during lunch.  when we were done eating she gave us little japanese mango gummy candies on our way at the door.i would definitely come back for lunch here--it's nothing fancy but very reasonably priced and well tasty. :)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
