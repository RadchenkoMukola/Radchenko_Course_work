"the adjectives that come to mind when i think of cafe zinho are cute quaint cozy and in a random area. i don't think i would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. i made a reservation for three on a tuesday night at 7. my two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant which scared me a little bit but i have to have faith in my fellow yelpers. the waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. you just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet unlike many of the other restaurants breads that i have had which i enjoyed. we ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers a potato rice and some roasted vegetables. great light combination and not too heavy. the size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. to top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but i thought this was so tasty. i kind of want one right now as i am typing this review.i am so glad i went to cafe zinho finally and would happily come back here again.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
