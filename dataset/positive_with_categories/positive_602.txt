"just ate there right next to gamestop & google has 3 small booths & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). food is fast fresh & hot but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. at the end of the meal i was just eating onions with rice though i hear this is healthy for you. counter lady was cordial but didn't reply when customers told her have a nice day #awkward. i know that english isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (i usually get this feeling eating asian). this is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (side note: food is very clean. brushed my teeth an hour before w/ tom's of maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
