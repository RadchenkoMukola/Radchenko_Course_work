"on our recent visit to pittsburgh my family and i had breakfast at the rusty nail in bellevue (dad's hometown).  the place is on the main street lincoln ave (or up street as my family called it).they were quite busy on a saturday morning but we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table.  i enjoyed a sausage omelet with american cheese and my husband had a denver omelet.  the omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  potatoes were and extra $2.29 but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  all adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.the service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.  it is cramped quarters but typical for neighborhood non-diner breakfast joints in urban areas.we had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings.  we will definitely go back when visiting pittsburgh.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
