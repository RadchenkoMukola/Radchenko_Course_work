"i've been to cafe zinho at least 25 times and i am sure to go back again soon.  the dining room is a funky garage space that has been converted into an eclectic europen bistro.  the food is very good and the atmosphere is relaxed and bohemian.  the puff pastry appetizer is always a winner.  the chef tony pais is portuguese but there are a lot of elements of french cuisine in his cooking. he used to own cafe zao and baum vivant both well regarded restaurants but i find the food is much more reasonable at zinho. there's a few tables outside and i find it enjoyable to choose those tables on a warm day.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
