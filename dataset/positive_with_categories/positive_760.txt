"took my son out on  a recent visit to pittsburgh second visit for us.  if you love italian food and cost is not a issue then this is the place.  the appitizers were enough to fillyou up.  we had the stuffed meatball which is the size of a softball.  melt in your mouth.  the pasta courses have alway been right on.  for main course we have tried several all fantastic but the veal chop was out of this word huge perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  jonathan's mom made one of the desserts a pumkin mousse/chiffon cake that my son said was the best he has ever tasted.  he requested i try to duplicate it for next thanksgiving.  in a word or two: outstanding pricey but worth it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
