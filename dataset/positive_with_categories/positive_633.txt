"i enjoyed this place but wasn't completely wowed.  i was told that it's portuguese but i'm not seeing what's so portuguese about it.  certainly a good continental restaurant by any means.  i liked the atmosphere and the service was good.  and the food was good too.  but for the price i didn't think the food was that great.  i'll come again but it won't be because i'm the one suggesting it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
