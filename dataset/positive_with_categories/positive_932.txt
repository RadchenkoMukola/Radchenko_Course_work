"they just opened a spot at carnegie mellon on campus in the gates building and it has changed my life. my closest coffee option before was seattle's best so you can imagine how delighted i was when this opened next door to where i have class all day.  the first week they were open i think i went there about 4 times.  the italian cappuccino will wire you for a few hours but is totally amazing.  their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though so stick with espresso drinks. i have also had two delicious paninis which i highly recommend.  knowledgeable service. great drinks! yum!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
