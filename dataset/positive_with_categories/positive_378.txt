"maybe tazza d'oro doesn't need another review but i guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good solid and well-run local business.  the coffee selection is terrific.  the baristas are professional and courteous.  no they are not chatty but they are polite and friendly.  i'm not there for conversation but for good coffee.  and that's what you get.  the pastries and snacks are fine.  good variety.  the atmosphere is just what i want when i need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet comfortable and calming.  when it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (i live in highland park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at others who stopped by.   they've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  the clientele is as folks said eclectic and invigorating.  it's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at park bruges or smiling banana leaf too!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
