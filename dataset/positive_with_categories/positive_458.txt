"pretty solid chinese takeout.  they have a $10 minimum on campus food and delivered in less time than expected.  the szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli zucchini corn carrots etc.).  the vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough - i don't know that i would order them again.overall i'm pretty pleased.  i already like this place - even the big neon sign that just says tasty on the storefront.   (this is how i'm going to refer to it - ie do you want some takeout from tasty?)  i also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice soup & an egg roll for $2.95!  i will almost definitely order from here again.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
