"i'm a vegetarian so a lot of times i have to just settle for an italian-no meat or a lack-luster veggie only sub... but the mediterranean at pizza perfectta is by far the best sub/hoagie i have ever ordered from a pizza place. garlicky not too soggy great cheese and flavorful toppings- i love it. i can't speak to any other hoagie because it's the only one i get. 5 stars everybody.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
