"the quiet storm was great. i started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. it had an unexpected texture but i still quite enjoyed it. for my entr√©e i had the spinach burger which was quite filling. it is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. i couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! their milkshakes also looked amazing - i would have tried one but i needed something to warm me up instead so i got a latte which was also very good. one other thing i thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. i haven't seen that before but it's a great idea!i was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu so i will need to go back to try more.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
