"let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is sooo good! the squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. seriously it was one of the best i've eaten and i've made it a point of sampling calamari. the entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good too. as for the carrot cob for dessert forget it. it only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
