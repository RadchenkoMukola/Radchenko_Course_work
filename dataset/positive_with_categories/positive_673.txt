"i took my boyfriend to casbah at the end of september for his birthday. we were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. our server her name has slipped my mind was excellent. i am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday of course i said let's get a bottle of red. we explained to our server what white varietals i enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. we started off with the papardelle. the rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! for entrees my boyfriend ordered the duck and i ordered the short rib ravioli. his words to describe the duck were life changing. i was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly but i agree it was excellent. the short rib was so tender and juicy. i was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. it was the best ravioli i have eaten hands down! for dessert we ordered a cheese tasting. it was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. i can't wait to go back to casbah and sample some other items-i would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if i could have!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
