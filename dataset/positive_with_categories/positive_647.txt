"meh.  seriously?  mediterranean?  what?  sorry but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant mediterranean.this was kind of a disappointment if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  the food was good and i had a great time but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.that said the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
