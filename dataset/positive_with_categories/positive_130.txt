"this is one of the few restaurants i frequent in the waterfront. why would you come to mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? you probably wouldn't. but you can swim in the great lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. not many places in pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a pittsburgh mystery to me). the restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. so you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  the food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). if you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. they will cook your food one of several ways. i like my fish broiled their signature is too salty for my liking. bread is mmmgood and hot (free). staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. i recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. a bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on long island's south shore (but that's another story). salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). bottom line is mitchell's at the waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
