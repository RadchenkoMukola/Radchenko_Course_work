"the food was excellent--i had the roasted garlic cream appetizer and orecchiette but between our table we tried half of the menu with no complaints.  the port flight was unique and the wine list was good.  the bartender has a little trouble with our cocktail orders but those were good as well.  the covered patio was perfect for a friday evening in late august--it was pouring outside and we stayed dry.  the service was so-so which i'm docking a star for.  the server was attentive but she was a little slow.  she also spilled the apple icewine on two of us while bringing out deserts and we were charged for those drinks.  it gets crowded so make a reservation.mad mex is still my favorite big burrito restaurant but casbah is great for a more formal gathering or date night.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
