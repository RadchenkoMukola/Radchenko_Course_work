"my word this place is outstanding. i have been here twice from out of town and both times were the highlights of my trips. the food is excellent this time i had the country burrito (double gravy yeah baby!). the portions are large and out quickly.the food is almost besides the point though because qs really excels in the refreshment department. this is one of the few places that makes me wish i had more than one life to live because i know without living in pgh i will never have a chance to try all of the incredible milkshake coffee lemonade and other cold and hot drink options. i mean they have tea milkshakes. extraordinary. service was friendly and quick. street parking is ample. the interior is bright and welcoming.6 stars. no. 7 stars.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
