"was impressed by the new menu and new decor.   our waitress was nice knowledgeable and attentive.  however the rest of the staff was less than stellar.  there was a power outage (less than one minute) while we were paying games (sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened). my family and i were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.   the games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  after the outage two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. when we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.  kinda a bummer we lost so much money on (malfunction) game play tonight.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
