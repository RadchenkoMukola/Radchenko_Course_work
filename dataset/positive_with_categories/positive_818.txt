"of the big burrito group restaurants casbah is the one that has never failed us.  consistent and delicious with great flavors of the mediterrean.  all of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.special occasions or hungry on a week night... casbah is a great stop",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
