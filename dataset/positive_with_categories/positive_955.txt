"so.much.fun! i wish i could play a song at the drop of a hat. too bad i never took piano lessons and i'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. unless it's salt n' pepa's shoop. this is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. it's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a saturday night. keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. the good thing is the food is coming from the attached rock bottom brewery. so a lot of it is restaurant quality good. plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! of course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. but you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! the guys who play are incredibly talented. there's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. they pretty much play anything you ask. contemporary songs throw back songs fight songs rap songs pop songs. you name it they play it. my favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. they'll all four get on stage and play two piano's a guitar and drums. they usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um journey of course!). the birthday song is seriously the best. they sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. but in a totally nice way of course. you just have to go!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
