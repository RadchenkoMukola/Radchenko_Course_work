"quiet storm occupies a special place in my heart compartment because one lazy sunday in 2004 i discovered alfred bester's the demolished man. imagine my joy: a cyberpunk fan finding a tattered copy of some anonymous-looking book in some proto-hipster cafe (this was back before it was toooo hipster) and discovering the glories of alfred bester. (seriously the demolished man is good.) it also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of pittsburgh in general and the hill district/lawrenceville/bloomfield in particular.anyway. i have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch and it was a pleasant if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. i got the true grits (yeah jeff bridges yeah) which was a huge bowl of grits (some shaved grocery store-feeling cheddar on top) a pile of delicious chopped lemony kale some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). overall it was fine. i didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!) nor did i dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele but shrug shrug.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
