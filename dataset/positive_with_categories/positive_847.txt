"i've been to the quiet storm a couple of times for brunch-type meals and have always been pleased.  their extensive veggie/vegan geared menu is for the most part really healthy and fairly light...but it's not without its crave-worthy items like smashed potatoes with cheese and my favorite the peanut butter chocolate milkshake...heavenly.  paired with a hummus and veggie sandwich and green pea 'moc-a-mole' you don't feel so naughty having dessert with brunch.the vibe is mellow and so is the wait staff.  service is leisurely but not slow.  i look forward to at least one chill breakfast here on my trips to the 'burgh to visit friends and such.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
