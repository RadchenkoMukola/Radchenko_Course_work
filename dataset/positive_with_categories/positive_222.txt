"my best friend took me to sing sing for my bachelor party. i had a blast. the musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. they also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). when the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected rock bottom restaurant for some grub. we all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.there were some drawbacks though. we went on a thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. and of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. but it's not our fault the place is empty on thirsty thursday if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. and sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. also there was no table service and the only bartender was a bitch. i'll probably be back but only for a special occasion when i can afford it.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
