"they have these tofu tenders which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.  i can't put my finger on it as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique but holy crap i can't get enough of them!  i had 3 orders in 2 days and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.the cheesy snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese and it's pretty slammin too.  the slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired but overall i know that it's one of a few places in pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
