"place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. you get a really big side of home fries too. this is probably my favorite place for breakfast in pittsburgh. i generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. service is usually fast and friendly. two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. i never remember to have cash until i get my bill so i have to run to the atm. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. the lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
