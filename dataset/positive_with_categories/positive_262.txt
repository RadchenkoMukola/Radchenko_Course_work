"i've heard about this place i've seen this place and i've wanted to try this place. finally yesterday my company took us their for lunch and i did not leave disappointed. don't get me wrong this is not a restaurant that is redefining the culinary scene in the city but it is a tasty place to enjoy your traditional burger fries and drink.the atmosphere is total sports bar but it is not overwhelmingly so. the staff was nice and for being in a party of 14 the server handled us well.the food was great! i got the salsa burger subbed with a turkey burger and it was delicious. the burger was plump and large full of flavor and cooked perfectly. i recommend this burger! it also had salsa and guac on top with some cheddar cheese and my mouth is still watering for it. tip? get the sweet potato fries!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
