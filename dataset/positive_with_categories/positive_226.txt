"duke...the owner...is the man.  he's a true pittsburgher and he loves everyone from pittsburgh.  he looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  he's also totally into the development of other pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next door...i believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  fortunately the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  very relaxing atmosphere.  i wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  still worth the drive to feel at home have a good bite and some cold beers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
