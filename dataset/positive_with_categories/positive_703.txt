"eaten here twicebut only pizza. i do have to say its up there with napolis or ailleos as for the pizza. tonight me and my neighbors were up for some more. was disappointed when ordering a meatball hoagie to find out they had no meatballs! pizza places should never run out of certain things. had gotten a cheese hoagie. didnt get get why someone would order this but was told it was good. didnt like. luckily the pep pizza was great but.. when u get toward the crust its all dough. still kick butt pizza but get rid of the cheese hoagie.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
