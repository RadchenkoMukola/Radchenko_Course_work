"my friend and i both had friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on thursday night. we settled on dave and busters. i went on facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)the games weren't *quite* as fun as i remembered but it was still a good time. the place was far from crowded and when a machine was out of tickets it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. when we did the team at d&b could not have been more accommodating. to apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. i think a lot of companies (i'm looking at you american airlines) could learn a lot from d&b. it cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games but it made our experience so much better.drinks are half-price after 8 or 9 my tropical mojito was awesome! my friend and i are definitely planning on going back on a wednesday for half-price games and half-price drinks.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
