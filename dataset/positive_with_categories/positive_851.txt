"the first time we went here assuming by the name that it must be a dive bar. we were disappointed but we were also hungry so we ordered dinner. it was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food. while there we couldn't help but notice all the articles and awards on the wall stating this was one of pittsburgh's best breakfast spots. so sometime later on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and i thought let's check out that rusty nail again. what a great decision. i think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious. mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing. the only downside is they only take cash (that's not uncommon around here) but they have an atm. also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasn't very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait. well ok one more thing the actual restaurant is very small and kinda lop-sided but hey i'd rather have a cheap delicious breakfast in a shitty place than pay more for a nicer atmosphere.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
