"i really love this little place. the hot bar is almost always completely wonderful. i especially love the breakfast/brunch on weekends it's one of my favorite meals. the potatoes and garbanzo bean patties are amazing.the prices are pretty much in line with any smaller heath and local food oriented grocer. i can usually count on them to have specific items that whole foods is sold out of and sometimes at a better price. plus the co-op hot bar is a million times better than the whole foods hot bar - quality over quantity all the way.short lines great staff good for pittsburgh.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
