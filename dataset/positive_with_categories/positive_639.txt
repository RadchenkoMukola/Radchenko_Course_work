"some of the best coffee in pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). really warm rich blends especially the espresso. the tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety so it's a great place for non-coffee-drinkers too. it has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). i've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. it's a good place to linger and savor. its proximity to the park is a big advantage.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
