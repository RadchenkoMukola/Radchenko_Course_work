"surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   first time at this location.  great service but wasn't hard to do.....had a combination orange shrimp and chicken and chicken fried rice.  it was typical pf changs (very good).  you can get the fried rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
