"this place was pretty cool.  i mean defiantly felt like a place with a bunch of regulars but i felt welcome inside.  all i got was a cup of coffee and a apple pastry.  my mother got a espresso.  both drinks were good but for being one of the top rated places on yelp i expected more than what i expirenced. the apple pastry did not seem very fresh but it was still very good and worth eating.  i guess i was just a little disappointed because i expected so much more than what i got.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
