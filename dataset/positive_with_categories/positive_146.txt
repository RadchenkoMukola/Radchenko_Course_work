"i don't understand the low reviews. this is a very well run neighborhood mcdonald's where retired folks seem to gather over coffee in the morning. i have been here a few times and service was always prompt and courteous. the food is consistent with mcdonald's everywhere and the restaurant clean.my only complaint was free att wifi was slow on my last visit.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
