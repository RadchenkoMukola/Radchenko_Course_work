"my friends and i went there without a reservation on thursday and it seemed like there was only one small table in front the door left. we had no problem with it. all staff there are very friendly and helpful. the place is quite small so maybe you should make a reservation in advance. one of nice things about this place is byob ($5 per a wine bottle). if you don't bring anything. you can walk to wine and spirits which is very close to the restaurant. so you can choose whatever you like to drink.most importantly the food was great! we had chicken livers and octopus for appetizer. for main dishes we had a whole fish with caper sauce and lamb racks. the entree dishes cost from $20-$35 and $28 in average.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
