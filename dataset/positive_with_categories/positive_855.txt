"finally great tuscan-style italian food in pittsburgh not that tasteless stuff that locals think is italian.the bread was warm and fresh. the bolognese sauce was creamy and rich and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. i love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.i'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options and next time i'm saving room for dessert! the display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
