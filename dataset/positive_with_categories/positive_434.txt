"i've never actually been to the restaurant but despite the plethora of pizza joints in the area (and believe me we've sampled a lot) this is the only place from which my partner in cuisine and i will order hoagies.  even when they got our order wrong once they were quick to fix it and deliver the replacements within a few minutes.  i can honestly say that the many times we have ordered from pizza perfectta we have never actually had the pizza (but i hear it's good).  we just keep gravitating back to those hoagies!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
