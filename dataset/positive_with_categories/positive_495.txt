"best coffee it pittsburgh? maybe but this place is certainly competitive. french press drip espresso or pour over? you name it they've got it. only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. if it is just coffee you want you this is the place. it is it a bit snobbish sure but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in pittsburgh.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
