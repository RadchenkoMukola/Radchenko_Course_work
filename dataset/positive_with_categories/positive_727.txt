"just got back (after looking for a taxi in this 3rd world city - but that's for another review) we liked the atmo.  liked eating under the outdoor extension under the well working heaters- it is fun and really makes it feel like a more unique dining experience.  ok now on to the food. we started with a spanish grilled octopus - it was delicious - charred grilled taste delightful blood orange accompaniment - perfect.  then had we not had the habitat beet salad yesterday (it was amazing - check my review) - this would be the best b u t it was still very good and had maytag blue cheese pistachios and nice beets - ok not amazing but nice beets. then we had another unfortunate comparison to habitat.  when we had the pork chop - generous portion but a bit fatty. (again habitat's was so much better)  we also had the new pasta dish on the menu which was ok - big scallops (4) but a less than impressive sauce.  glad we went here - it was different but not really special and the nightmare of getting a taxi back was just -- well a nightmare (what is wrong with pittsburgh taxi service -- everything)  city fathers (and mothers) -- fix this!!!!!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
