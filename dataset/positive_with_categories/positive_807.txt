"this place is great! cute inside great milkshake and hot and cold coffee drink options. we had the horchata was didn't taste exactly like horchata but was delicious. we ordered the bah mi which came with two types of fake meat on it. it wasn't a traditional tasting bah mi as it didn't have enough jalepanos cilantro and it was much heavier but the bread was good and all in all it was a delicious sandwich. we also had the flower salad which comes with a heavy dose of kale and smoked tempeh. really really good with the peanut dressing! tempeh is soft and very flavorful. will get again. found out that they are closing/ moving to an unspecified location next week so we hope that they will be there on our next trip through pittsburgh!",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
