"my vegan friend deb turned me onto the fact that one can dine at pf chang's and stay on a vegan diet.vegan friend deb (vfd) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. the waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version but it was never put on the menu.warning: even though it's vegan it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt fat and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. the vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.they also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic eggplant and garlic and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.i always loved the fact pf chang's offered brown rice. that nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.the service staff at chang's is always top shelf i've never had a bad time here and love when we go.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
