"six of us went to dinner six of us had fabulous meals!  my husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best he ever ate not a bit fishy--loaded with fresh seafood and a spicy sauce.  my son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous.  my daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal (it is a large appetizer) and i also sampled it--the vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly.  my father had the skirt steak which he loved and my son had a sausage pizza.  both said they were delish!  i usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time i had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce.  it was excellent!  it was my father's birthday and they brought out a tiramisu for us to share (we didn't even ask for it) and that was luscious as well!  the staff was as nice as can be--we will be back without a doubt!i love this place!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
