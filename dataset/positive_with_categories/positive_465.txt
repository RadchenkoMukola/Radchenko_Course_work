"casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in p-burgh; in fact usually when i go somewhere else i wind up regretting that i didn't just go to casbah. every dish i've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi tuna tartare arugala salad bread pudding and pretty much every soup. the short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. the menu is so inventive!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
