"this was actually the first time i've ever been to a dave and buster's.walking into such a huge space especially coming from the often narrow venues in san francisco was strange.un-nerving actually. because dave and buster's is all about excess. almost obscenely so.as far as food - their stuff is standard. most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. at all actually. you have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.but most people don't come to dave & buster's for food. they come for the games.and while i've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  i was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and i found myself really enjoying myself.especially once i realized that i have mad skills at skee ball. and proceeded to dominate.trust.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
