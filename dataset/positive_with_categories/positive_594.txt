"probably one of the top 5 meals i've had in the last 10 years.  i travel a lot for work and have enjoyed the benefit of eating at some of the finer establishments in ny la chicago sf and london. true it's in a horrible part of town (there was a robery at the liquor store next door about 10 minutes before we left) and the place is tiny.  but you will not be sorry about making the trek to this place.  i got the cowboy steak gorgonzola but someone in your party has to get one of the veal dishes they are out of this world.  you can have the veal smothered in the gorgonzola sauce from the steak which was amazing (also probably took 5-10 minutes off my life span but oh well).on the flip side don't be fooled into thinking that because the place is in a war-zone and it's small that you'll get a good deal.  it was also one of the more expensive meals i've had in some time.  so be prepared to have a great meal but you will pay for it.
