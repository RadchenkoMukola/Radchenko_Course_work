"not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good (my favorite in pittsburgh) but by far not inexpensive. the best thing you can do and i am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews is join the big burrito group mailing list; you will receive a free coupon for an entr√©e around your birthday to be used within a certain time period...makes it a really good deal. oh their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced...call up to find out their current corking fee (i think around $15 bucks) and bring a better bottle at a better price than you are willing to spend there.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
