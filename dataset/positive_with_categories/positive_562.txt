"rock bottom on thursday nights is the place to be. team trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. the dj (todd) is great. the food is good but the ball park pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip is the best. the wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things a few servers are excellent. i am not a beer drinking so i haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks i've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. on nights that are not trivia nights rock bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. larger parties will usually be split into two tables. overall an enjoyable place at which i am a regular.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
