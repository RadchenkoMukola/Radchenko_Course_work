"my bf took me here on my birthday and it was so good he totally sealed the deal.  this was on of the best dining experiences i've had in pittsburgh...made even sweeter by the fact i left full and without feeling the boyfriends wallet was just raped.  i had the orichiette pasta and it was love in a bowl.  savory and sweet and perfectly balanced.  boyfriend had short rib ravioli and it was so good that when i asked him if i could have a taste he told me that he loved me and he knew it was my birthday and he let me have a bite but he didn't want to share.  i didn't make him i just know it was excellent.i have officially done dat all of the big burrito restaurants & i honestly feel like has bought is the most effortlessly sophisticated of all of them.  this is amazing food in a restaurant that is sophisticated without even trying.i really feel like has bought is highly underrated and you'd best get your arse over here to dying. they have a brunch which i hear is amazing and i can't wait to try it out.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
