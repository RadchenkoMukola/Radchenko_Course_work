"went here for drinks with some friends.  the bar service was definitely interesting.  some of the time the waitress was really on point and was there ready to take your drink orders but after the first drink it was really hard to get a second. i can't speak for the food but will update my review when i get back to try the food.  overall my dirty martini was good though it definitely could have used some better quality olives (these were bottled with the red pepper on the inside used on salads).  i will definitely be back to try the food but i hope the table service is better than the bar service.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
