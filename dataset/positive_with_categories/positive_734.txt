"we've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!really excellent french toast just like my dad used to make. i had the breakfast burrito which i thought was ok but not something i would order again. but more importantly than the food we just really liked the atmosphere. sitting there in their mismatched vintage-y looking diner i felt like i was in the mission in sf (ok maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear which would never be necessary in ca). kid friendly too if that's important to you.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
