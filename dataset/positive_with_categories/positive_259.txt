"my husband and i went to casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  we were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  so much for romantic!  ever hear of a babysitter?  anyway ambience aside let's get to the food which overall i would give a c+.  we started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  the perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  we each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  i grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. these tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in december.  very disappointing.  i opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  it was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  another disappointment.  my husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  all this said the service was professional we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and i their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  i might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  and we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children otherwise we would have stayed home.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
