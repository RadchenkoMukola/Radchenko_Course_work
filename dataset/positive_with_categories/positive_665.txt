"my friend and i have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. for a thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. there were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. we ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). i was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. i even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist not dried out. this wasn't bad for a first visit so i will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. i'm only giving uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. hello! the plate was yellow! how could she not have seen that?!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
