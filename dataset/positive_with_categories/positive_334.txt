"i was unimpressed with my food and i am even more sad to see now that p.f chang's mass produces frozen dinners. this is about as far away from chinese food you can get unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice. the restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud.  i had to yell to carry on a conversation. p.f chang's in the waterfront is a unmemorable experience. maybe i would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
