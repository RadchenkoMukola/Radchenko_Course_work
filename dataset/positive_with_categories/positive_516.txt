"i've never been crazy about the food here but my friend likes it so i do eat here once in a while. we stopped in last night and i had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. the food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. the ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. my friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon which is what she orders just about every time she's there. it looked delicious and the portion was huge. i'll be trying this dish next time we're there. we've also had the ball park pretzels in the past and they're really good. i'm giving 4 stars because the service was great there's outdoor seating and the berry bash sangria was delicious (if expensive). we'll be back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
