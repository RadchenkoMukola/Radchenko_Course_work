"my husband and i went to mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. we both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). i can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and i've always been please with everything. pros: nice friendly waitress who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary) food was excellent and not extremely overpriced restaurant and bathrooms were clean!cons: none on this visit or any previous visits",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
