"oh i love this place.  it has a great menu and wine list.  it has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  i took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  the staff was really friendly - realized i was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.we dined outside and i felt tucked away in a europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.it is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
