"had a wonderful beef and pulled pork burger at buffalo blues yesterday. the food and drinks were great;however as far as i could discern this sports bar only had one waitress trying to cover over 30 customers. and this on a saturday with the world cup games. i saw only one waitress and a bar man. the gal was valiantly trying to keep up. but the burger was great.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
