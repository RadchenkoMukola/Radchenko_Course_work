"decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. the sauce and cheese are perfect but the crust falls short.  it has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy but the crust lacks much flavor. maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? the pizza is decent enough though and merits a try perhaps it was an off day for eddies.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
