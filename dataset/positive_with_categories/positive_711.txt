"went for dinner friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. it is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. the sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. the chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth it was awesome. the cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. i had the carrot cake for dessert it is big enough for 3 people. it was so delicious. my friend had the creme  brûlée which she said was very good. i was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
