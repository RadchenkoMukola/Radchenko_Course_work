"this is my go-to place for curing a hangover. i don't know what it is about chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round but it does the trick. i also like to come here before i go grocery shopping at the nearby trader joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.all of my favorites are here veggie lo mien string beans mac 'n cheese crab rangoon hot & sour soup i haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. another thing i miss is creamed spinach... i have yet to see this dish on a pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among chines buffets.another star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
