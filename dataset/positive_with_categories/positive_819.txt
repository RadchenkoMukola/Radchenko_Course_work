"you don't have to be a vegetarian or vegan to enjoy quiet storm.i've been here for both breakfast and lunch and haven't been disappointed.  the menu has a good selection of both vegetarian and vegan dishes and the specials change daily.the only issue i have had is with service. on a particularly crowded sunday i asked twice for a coffee refill and the waiter never filled my cup or even checked in after our food came out.  i know it was busy but other tables seemed to be doing just fine.  despite the poor service i returned and haven't had any problems since.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
