"after having a few 'less than memorable' trips to d&b in years past my wife and i  decided to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday.  pgh happy hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  anyway- pgh hh was celebrating an anniversary and chose d&b for the location.  the d&b staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  our server carla was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  the other server back there was working equally as hard but i never got the chance to get her name.  i had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never got the chance to give them any credit.  i think d&b is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
