"i enjoy coming to casbah because it reminds me of the fresh local elements i so enjoy about the napa and sonoma valleys. casbah gets a lot of produce and meats from local farms and i love that!i also love the cheese selections here. i usually ask my waiter to surprise me with any combination and it's always fantastic. i am a sucker for the duck here. it's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. absolutely delicious. the gnocchi on the side is fantastic. i also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale as well as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.the wine list is pretty good and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings which is nice because sometimes you just want to sit back relax and let someone else do the work.you can't go wrong with any of the pastas. it's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. it's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. the orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. yum!if you're not absolutely stuffed at this point try the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding for dessert. you won't be disappointed!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
