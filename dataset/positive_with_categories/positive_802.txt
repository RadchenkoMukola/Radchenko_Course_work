"this is my favorite big burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. gotta be honest though. just about every time i'd been here it's with colleagues which means lots and lots of boozing!! therefore consequently as a result in sum i don't have a crystal clear memory of what i had for appetizer entree dessert etc. what i can tell you is that i had never been disappointed with anything i've ordered here. and believe you me if the food is not that good i will remember it no matter how drunk i am. sure it's not exactly a mediterranean restaurant but who cares? the food is great it's in a super cute hood the atmosphere is cozy and comfy and the service is always spot on. i do recall that the very last time i ate here was with a dear friend and two of her british colleagues and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. i had the arugula --one of my favorite words. it's lovely no? say it with me. a -ru-gu-la! fun right?!! and so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. what about dessert you ask? sorry kids. by that time i really was drunk and i can't remember. it was super tasty though! i remember everyone liking mine the best. sure do sugar!so pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. it's a great date or small group place. oh and super fantastic wine list too!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
