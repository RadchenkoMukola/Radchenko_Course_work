"well since i stop here on my way home from work every friday i have to give it 5 stars.  some of my favorite pizza in pittsburgh.  the cheese blend is really good.  firm not too greasy and the sauce is really well balanced.  but how about the crust?  really nice texture.  perfect chewiness.  i would recommend perfectta to anyone!",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
