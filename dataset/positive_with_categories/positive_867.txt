"casbah was such a great experience. i dined here with my boyfriend and 2 friends for my birthday. drinks are fairly priced. they offer wine flights and champagne flights. the food was wonderful! i started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. didn't expect to see it on the menu here but it was really good. my party got the tuna tartare and 2 different olive dishes. seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) i would have expected a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. but it was a bowl full. and they were yummy. for entrees we had the duck breast which according to my boyfriend is the best and most perfectly cooked duck he's ever had. i had a prosciutto plate it was technically an app but it's my birthday and i'll eat what i want! another member had the cioppino and she loved it. we then got their birthday dessert which was a chocolate cake with ganache and brûlée ice cream. it was great. i couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
