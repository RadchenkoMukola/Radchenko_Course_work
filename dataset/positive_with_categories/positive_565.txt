"best mussels!!! they were large and quite tasty.  the starter bread is corn bread and it is absolutely addicting.  my boyfriend and i had dinner on a whim on a weekday and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  the setting is intimate and i enjoyed it.  i only wish we would've brought a bottle of wine since it's byob. the service was excellent as well. i have no complaints even if it is cash only i think it's worth it. note: cash only.  they do have an atm inside for your convenience. byob",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
