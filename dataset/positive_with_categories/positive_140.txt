"i love tazza d'oro! it is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.it it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot) but i like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.i usually get iced americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. all of the drinks i have ever had here have been tasty. i have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.i'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. while i don't live in highland park it's definitely worth an occasional trip.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
