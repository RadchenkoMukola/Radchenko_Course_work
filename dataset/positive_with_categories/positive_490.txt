"great cafe for brunch and coffee. lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. if you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
