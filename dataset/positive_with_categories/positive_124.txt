"i decided to grab dinner on a saturday night at quiet storm. it wasn't packed so i grabbed a seat at the bar. i ordered their graham street tofu sandwich with their 'chorizo' soup and a shampoo soda. the graham street tofu sandwich and soup were very good but the shampoo soda was interesting to say the least and wouldn't order it again. i was nervous i wouldn't get good service after reading some of the reviews but the waiter was friendly and checked in at the right times. i would definitely come back to quiet storm since they've got me curious about their other dishes. i also like the laid back vibe of the place bringing me back to forrest gump time.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
