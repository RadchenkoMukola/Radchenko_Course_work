"i've really enjoyed their pizza so far. i also ordered a chicken salad and it was tasty for a pizza take out place nothing too fancy. i have only had the food at this place by delivery and it has always come before and hour has passed. the pizza always comes warm and ready to eat. nothing to complain about. i did give it only 4 stars because there are a couple of other places that serve homemade ranch on the side which makes the pizza taste even extra delicious.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
