"pros: vegan food in pittsburgh?  yes!  great music friendly accommodating service huge variety of drinks fabulous decorcons: not a convenient location for the car-less me but well that's just mehi i am a non-drinker and rarely have i found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  granted quiet storm like many pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  ginger lemonade?  yes.  all these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  yeah!i do love my meat but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but i attribute that to my love of meaty things).  they used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends but i think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  too bad most of pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.usually good music acts here.  although the few times i was here there was barely anybody else there besides the group i dragged along and the band's friends.  usually 2-3 acts play.  live.  and it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  and be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  the bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.i have never been here during the daytime so i can't comment on that.  always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  there are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
