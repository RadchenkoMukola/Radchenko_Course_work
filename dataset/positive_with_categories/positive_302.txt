"i got pizza here on a saturday night in a pinch.  looking for a place that sells by the slice i drove around for a while.  not only did they have by-the-slice pizza but they also had some of my favorite toppings.  i also hate crust that's too thick and -- although i prefer it even thinner than it was -- i was pretty satisfied with the crust.  the only thing that could be improved is the salad.  we got a grilled chicken salad.  the chicken and fries were okay but the rest was pretty run of the mill.as for the pizza i'll definitely be back for more.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
