"the sunday brunches serve great pancakes and i always felt so fancy eating here as a kid.  note that if you wait until the churches let out to get in line that there will be a long queue outside.  the rest of the menu ranges from decent to average but the food is always cheap.  the tables are so close together it feels like you're crawling over your neighbors to be seated.  on nicer summer days and during any of the bellevue events they often serve fresh lemonade or iced tea outside.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
