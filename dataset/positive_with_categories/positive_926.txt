"let me first say that i have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have never been to a veg restaurant before. looking through the menu here i actually got excited because i didn't have to ask does this have meat in it a million times. there were so many choices! i have the excitement of the little girl on despicable me it's so fluffyyyy! my excitement aside the menu was pretty large for all veg food. they have breakfast all day which is always ok with me. prices were average (~8.50) and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (although i have heard that the cuban sandwich is on the small side).i had the banh mi which was fabulous. the bread was fresh aioli was nice vegs were pickled just right but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). i was surprised by the veg seisage. it was really good. gazpacho was nice although i am not really a fan of cold soup. it reminded me of a smoother salsa. good but just not my thing.sarah s. had the special home fries with chili and cheese.  this was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. she was happy with it. latte's are good too.all in all this was a good experience! i think this is my new favorite place.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
