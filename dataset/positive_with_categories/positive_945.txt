"this place is categorized as portugese but i thought the menu was more mediterranian than anything else.  bacalhau (dried salted fish - the national dish of portugal) was nowhere on the menu; which is just fine by me!  the restauarnt has an eclectic decor and a nice setting.  the only tough part is parking in shadyside... but on this night i managed to get a spot right in front of the restaurant.for dinner i had lobster ravioli (a special) and my date had mushroom ravioli.  both were outstanding.   peering around at other tables i saw several other delectable creations that i would like to return and try.  the peri peri chicken looked quite good.this another of the local byob restauarnts which makes me happy.  we brought a nice bottle of pinot noir which always helps to make the dining experience more pleasurable.this is an excellent find... i will be back.  soon.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
