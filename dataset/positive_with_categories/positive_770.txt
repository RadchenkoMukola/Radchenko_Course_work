"i went on a date with my girlfriend here and it was a great experience.  charming outside dining area with excellent service and a knowledgeable staff.  i will say that the food was a bit overpriced but that's to be expected in shadyside.  great selection of fresh seafood - i had the salmon and it was delicious.  reasonably priced wine list as well. i would recommend casbah for a special event or if you're rolling in the $$.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
