"stopped by on a mon evening after trying to dine at smoke taqueria which is closed mondays. parking on street in front or behind off hay st. super friendly bartender. in warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. bet it's a fun place in warmer months.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
