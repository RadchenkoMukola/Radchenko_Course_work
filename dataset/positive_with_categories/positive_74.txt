"i love quiet storm! i think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. the country burrito is bomb! so good there has to be crack in the gravy. i also enjoy the tahini queso i often add it to my burrito. it's best on the nachos. for around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. they also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! it's a vegan dream come true. it does get a little crowded during saturday mornings so expect a wait but completely worth it. the atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (garfield) which also means they often play good music! last time i was there it was all neil young! accompanied my burrito perfectly! i definitely recommend this place to vegans & non-vegans alike!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
