"on a random sunday morning i went in search of a good breakfast spot.  i decided to explore the mckees rocks neighborhood and came upon marge's place.  i hadn't heard much about this place but after reading the few reviews i could find i decided to give it a try.  inside it's bigger than i expected but still has that down home diner feel.  my guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  the wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me someone they had never seen before.  i picked a table in the corner so i could observe what i imagine was a typical sunday morning.  i ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon potatoes and toast.  any place that has mancini's italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  being in mckees rocks though they really don't have a choice.  the potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  the only way i can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  is that even a word?  i just don't know how else to descibe it.  the combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  one random note: i liked the tables and chairs.  they were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  good distance between the table and chairs.  that may sound silly and i thought so too at first.  but when i go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow it can hinder my enjoyment.  not only will i return but i will also recommend marge's place to anyone in the area.  it was a surprisingly good find.  i like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
