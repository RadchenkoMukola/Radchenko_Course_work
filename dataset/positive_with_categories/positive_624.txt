"i like this eat'n park. even though it is a chain not all of them are created equal. the wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an eat'n park is worth patronizing.  eating here i change my mentality a bit. i always order the seven dollar bbq burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. in my mind i always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. when the salad bar is kept stocked it has some really good and fresh items. i love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. i wish other eat'n parks were more like this one.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
