"i've been introduced to their kale offerings and must admit i'm a huge fan. there's a kale salad that you can ask them to put in a wrap and it's absolutely phenomenal. almost all of their veg options are fantastic.the downside of qs is their sunday brunch. i know i know most brunches are breakfast foods only and this place is no exception. on a personal level i don't really care for breakfast food for lunch and since you have no other choices it's not my thing. like i said though this place is fantastic for veg food so give it a try.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
