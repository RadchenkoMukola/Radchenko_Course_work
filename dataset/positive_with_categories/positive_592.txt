"what you haven't been to bellisario's yet? this is about the only red sauce pizza i ever get a craving for and boy howdy is it good. the crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. the dough itself is flavorful not too... well doughy. the sauce is great and they don't drown the pizza in it. there's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. if you can go while mama's working all the better.you can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. you can't beat that. and i'd put bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.i grew up a five minute walk away. my mom loved bellisario's and i have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. every time i have a slice it brings back great memories. but i've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as i think it is.it's a little divey stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza but it's perfect. if you're in west mifflin (say going to kennywood) drive over and eat a pizza. they've also got hoagies and calzones and i think that's about it. but with pizza this good who cares?",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
