"i love this restaraunt. rarely have i ever received service like i get here. the food is good definitely reasonable for the price. the thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked to temperature. this rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. but the servers are fantastic. very attentive polite and timely. the beer selection is awesome we always order the sampler. i like having lots of options as far as beverages go. the wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night. and they most often call you before the quotes time. the desert menu is a little small but i could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good not to crammed or noisy. they also have outside seating available when the weather is nice i highly recommend this establishment!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
