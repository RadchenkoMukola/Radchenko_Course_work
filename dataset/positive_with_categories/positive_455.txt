"this is the only place i order delivery pizza from.  they do a good job on their gourmet and specialty pizzas.  the bbq chicken is good.the wings are average.  generally small and cheap with a seemingly storebought generic hot sause. nothing terribly special.  averagethe hoagies are ok.  dont get a cold cut or italian style.  i'd stick with something like the hot sausage or chicken parm.  they tend to be better.  and they are huge.  like 16 for a whole.the calzones are massive and tasty as well.  go with heavy veg or a combination of meat and veg.  the breaks up the bread and cheese flavor.  well at least i've found them to be better anyway.the pasta is expensive as heck and is average.  not a place to order pasta from unless its one of those lazy nights where you need that craving filled.salads are typical.all in all not a bad place.  better than other pizza places in the area.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
