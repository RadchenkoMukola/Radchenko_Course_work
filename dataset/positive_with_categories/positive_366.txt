"this is a well run restaurant with great food great consistency and excellent service.  we were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  i highly recommend the cheese plate it is probably the best in pittsburgh.  the arugula salad is delicious.  so is the alaskan halibut.  you really can't go wrong with casbah.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
