"this was the first place we tried after moving to bellevue and over a year later we still order almost weekly.  their staff is really friendly delivery always quick (or  at least doesn't ever take longer than the estimated time given) and food is delicious.  five stars for the staff and the food but four stars because i wish they had better specials.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
