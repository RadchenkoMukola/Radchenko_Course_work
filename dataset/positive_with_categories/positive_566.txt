"my boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. there are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. my boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  there is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer pasta main course a salad and and dessert. i thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . they are also very generous with the bread which i loved!!!!every meal was made to perfection. it had a homey feeling .....my boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  my entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. there were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. the service was great. all in all it was an amazing experience. the chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .this is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.not to dressy and not too casual. pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown. im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
