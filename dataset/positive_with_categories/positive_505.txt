"mixed results.  made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? methinks not.  i had to ask to be moved to the patio which was much better.the drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). later they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. appetizers (meatballs with brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  the texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right sort of dry maybe overcooked.  we had a bread pudding for dessert which was probably the best part of the meal. i expect a better overall experience for the money.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
