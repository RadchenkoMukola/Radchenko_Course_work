"not quite authentic but good enough for pittsburgh. it's the only place that i've found that even comes close to a classic chicago style deep dish.i also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. the croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.my girlfriend really enjoyed her caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.overall i enjoyed it and would come back the next time i get a craving for a deep dish pizza. it wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
