"i used to work there and i just love east end food co-op.  the place has definitely got soul awesome folks at co-op.  so many local options such good produce and awesome prepared foods.  sure some of the prices are high but if you learn to shop it there are also great values everywhere.  and i really appreciate that they stick their neck out and are spending time and money in the fight to label gmo's.  it's important issues like this that really define our co-op imo.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
