"a great little place. i love their produce fruits meats and spices. they carry alot of very hard to find skin care products that i love. they were even the first place in pittsburgh that carried carol's daughter products. they also carry pre made salads sandwiches and wraps. sure it's not as big as i would like but it's still a great place. if you like whole foods and trader joe's you will like this place as well.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
