"i had always meant to visit enrico's and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.so here's what i liked: the cappuccino was perfect. it's an awesome cappuccino topped with a cute foam art leaf.here's what i didn't like: sometimes i take my cappuccino plain sometimes i take it with a shot of syrup. on this occassion i asked if i could get amaretto syrup which they had. but the barista responded: no you can't. he said they only make their cappuccino plain and if i liked sweet he could make me something special but i would have to trust his taste. here's the thing...i don't like sweet! i don't have much of a sweet tooth. i just wanted a tiny bit of sweet so i didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. i just got it plain.i'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a real cappuccino tasted like. please i lived in italy i've had a real cappuccino...but right now i want a flavor shot in it. i still tipped because i wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place and he did offer to make me something different. i just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not allowed to add them to your drink? it's a 5-star cappuccino for sure but i had to subtract a star for the attitude.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
