"my wife and i go to casbah every year for my birthday. it is my favorite of the big  burrito restaurants and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. this time i started with the parsnip & chestnut soup garnished with braised chicken arugula & almond pesto. it was divine with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. my main course was elysian fields farm lamb loin with flageolet beans merguez sausage turnips greens and whole grain mustard. it was cooked perfectly pink as ordered and the flavors complemented each other.for dessert i skipped my usual chocolate - they offered chocolate mousse chocolate cheesecake and dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. i decided to try the pumpkin bread with butter rum sauce and cream cheese ice cream.  the cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
