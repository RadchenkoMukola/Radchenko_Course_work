"my wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh which is about 10 years.  this is our go-to chinese restaurant even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  i have never had a bad meal here and i will forever love their beef chow fun!  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  these are great folks and i wish them the best of success in the future.  remember everyone just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  some people just have lousy taste buds and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  try things for yourself and you will find some great food at tasty!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
