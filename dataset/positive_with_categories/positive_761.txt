"i like panera bread but this one is a so so. i always get my fuji chicken salad in every panera bread i go. all of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. they just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. i was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but i am disappointed after trying it. don't know if we will be back again.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
