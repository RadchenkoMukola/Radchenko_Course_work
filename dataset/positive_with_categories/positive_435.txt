"had a wonderful experience with a large group of friends on a busy labor day weekend. we brought a few bottles of wine which we paired up with various apps and the dinner. corkage was an extremely nominal fee which left room in the wallet for more delectable food. the service was smooth and very friendly. the atmosphere was inviting with a small european-style cafe restaurant vibe. food was fresh and tasty according to all of my friends and was simply amazing from my perspective.  the sardines app and the portuguese mariscada seafood stew which i had/shared were cooked perfectly and flavorful. chef/owner toni pais's back story and his culinary skills are inspirational. he came out to eat afterwards and was very humble when he was given a round of applause. this is truly an underground spot worth finding when in the burgh a city that's now a hotbed for excellent food and cafe zinho is one of the reasons why!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
