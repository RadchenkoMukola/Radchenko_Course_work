"delicious!  everything i've ever had here was great!  the white pizza is a must!  always amazing!  i'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  the bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  they have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  their prices are also reasonable.  overall i highly recommend this place!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
