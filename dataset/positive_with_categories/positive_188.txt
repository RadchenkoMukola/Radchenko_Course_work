"fantastic little restaurant. i had the duck... it was to die for. food was delicious atmosphere was warm classy inviting and the staff members were all super kind and professional. make sure you make a reservation though... it's a tiny place. it's pricey... but worth every penny.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
