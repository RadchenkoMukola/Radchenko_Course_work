"this place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. it offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. still ha that neighborhood feel though. i have never had food there though they offer paninis. great desserts. good espressos and okay coffee.outdoor seating. good place to study. plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
