"last week was my first visit to this place. the raspberry tea was amazing. we got the app sampler  it was very good except for the homemade guacamole. i ordered a side salad hardly any dressing on it and not very fresh. i ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli & grilled vegetables.  waited along time for the entr√©e.  the chicken was good but a small portion.  the broccoli & veggies were water logged. lots of water on the plate. tried my friends fried shrimp it was good with good flavor. might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so i would give it another shot.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
