"i rather like bar louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie.  been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights your pocket book will thank you.the two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation quantity and quality.i would highly recommend the bruschetta pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone).",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
