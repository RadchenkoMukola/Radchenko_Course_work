"this is by far my favorite panera location in the pittsburgh area. friendly plenty of room to sit and good quality food & coffee. panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free wifi! try their toasted sandwiches especially the chicken bacon dijon.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
