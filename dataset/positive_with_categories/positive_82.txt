"i love stopping by here for a juice and take-out food from the cafe.  it's one of the few places i've found in pittsburgh serving fresh-pressed and organic juices. my favorite juice combo is the carrot apple and ginger aka ginger wabbit.  although they can be a little pricey certain juices are sometimes on special so keep your eye out!  they also have plenty of smoothie and coffee bar options if juices and wheat grass shots aren't really your thing.  don't be afraid to ask the staff member for some recommendations!the hot food/salad bar has great vegetarian and vegan options.  usually the selections include roasted veggies homemade soups tofu and tempeh options kale and some kind of grain.  on the back wall of the store they have a selection of already packaged salads sandwiches mock tuna and chicken salad hummus marinated tofu great to grab and go or enjoy for lunch in the cafe.i can't comment much on the store selection because i mostly stick to the prepared foods and juice bar.  they also have a large selection of nutritional bars including the local companies such as barre and nugo.  don't be intimidated to give east end food co-op a shot the staff is totally helpful and the healthy fresh lunch options are worth stopping in for!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
