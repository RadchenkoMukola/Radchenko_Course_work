"i did not know this is a franchise restaurant until i had looked it up on the internet. this is the only restaurant i was not familiar with by the waterfront. my mom and me sat on the outdoor patio the weather was very nice on a breezy summer day. there was a great prix fixe special for $23 what a great price for regular portion salad---the dressing was too sweet for me---entree and mini dessert.the fish was fresh. my mom's chilean sea bass shanghi style came with sticky rice and spinach. the sea bass had nice texture and was reasonably priced. my lobster and shrimp pappardelle had more shrimp than i expected. my desert was creme brulee which was very good. i love a good sugar coated dessert.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
