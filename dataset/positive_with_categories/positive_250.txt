"first time eating at pf chang- thought the food was fine but i'd rather go to an authentic chinese restaurant any day. it felt like a chinese version of the cheesecake factory.  anyway it was a saturday late afternoon and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food.  i don't know if they were just short staffed the day we went but i wasn't impressed with the service.some nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping. the sesame chicken was also very good.  other things were fine just not memorable.  i think this is an ok place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the waterfront and don't mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner. if you want to get in and out in a hurry don't come here.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
