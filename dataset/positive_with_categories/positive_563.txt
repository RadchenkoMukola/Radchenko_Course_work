"the pizza here is amazing. the crust is crunchy on the outside but not too thin so it's also chewy on the inside.  i always go for pepperoni and mushroom or ham and pineapple. i cannot add much to this review on delivery or other items because i always get pizza for takeout; however i did try the garden salad and wouldn't recommend it if you want more than iceberg with a couple of cucumber slices. bonus tip: show up early for your takeout to play some pinball! they just swapped in a new one - tron.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
