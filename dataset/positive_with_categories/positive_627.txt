"it had been a very very long time since i'd visited quiet storm. for some weird reason i had in my head that they made these awesome smoothies. well... they do not. but they make milkshakes. any other day i would have totes been into the shake but...i reeeeeally wanted a smoothie so i opted out of the milkshake (i know a rare occasion) and went with a iced chai. i love that they make their own mix of chai and they also don't sweeten it so you can sweeten it yourself. super sweet chai is super gross. just sayin'. i also ordered the sesame noodle platter (noodles soy tofu red cabbage mushrooms broccoli onions peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. it was a solid meal. i mean it wasn't necessarily a platter (i think a variety of separate items) but a noodle dish. i liked that there was a decent amount of veggies and not just a few with a massive amount of noodles. i hate when that happens! it was also lightly sauced not too heavy and sticky. plus the fried tofu was awesome! honestly i've never had such good tofu before. i rarely get it because i think tofu can be so bland but this was bomb! a nice plus is it's a great environment to eat and work. free wifi and nice big tables to work on. plus throw in friendly service and it's a win!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
