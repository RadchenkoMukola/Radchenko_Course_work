"what a gem of a place in shadyside.  it s places like this that makes me miss living there.  food was outstanding!  because it was our first time we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh a clam dish forgot name with the best tomatoe-white wine i could have drunk from the bowl broth; becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again could have drunk it good).  i m usually not fan of walnut in my salad but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it that i ate it happily.  good pairing.  the special of the night we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato slither of zucchini and a stem of green onion but the star afterall was the lamb and it was meduim perfect just as i ordered!  would you care for some dessert? ramon our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  and so round 3 begins.  coffee a chocolate mousse with whip cream beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  i thought it had a hint of peanut butter but not sure.  regardless it was  so so divine.this place was busy but we did not feel rushed unlike most places.  the service was great the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele from what i gathered.  we shall return.finally on an end note. cafe zinho is byob so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  and they only take cash or personal check but they do have an atm.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
