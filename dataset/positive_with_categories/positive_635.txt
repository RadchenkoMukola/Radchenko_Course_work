"one of my all time favorite restaurants in pgh casbah is still going strong 15 years later. today's lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad. they use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable interesting fresh food around.  also great for sunday brunch.  you won't be disappointed.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
