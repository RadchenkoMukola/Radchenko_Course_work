"this used to be my all time favorite restaurant for dinner in pittsburgh. the food is always top notch - lunch dinner and brunch. i think for brunch they offer one of the best bloody mary's in the city with just the right amount of kick! my favorite dinner entree was the casericcia - not sure if i spelled it correctly. why did they ever remove it from the menu is anyone's guess. it was amazing. i went there for my birthday dinner and was ready to order it when the waiter explained that they removed it from the menu despite it being one of their most popular dishes. what a total let down. nothing compares to it in my book. that's the only reason i'm giving casbah a 4 star review... please please please bring it back!!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
