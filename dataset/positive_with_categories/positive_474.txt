"we went here for valentines day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else. we both loved it. the calamari is outstanding and if you get there before 7 they run happy hour which is half off apps and $3 beers. i had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. the steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being valentines day. despite the busyness the wait staff was very attentive.my wife's steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level. we will def be back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
