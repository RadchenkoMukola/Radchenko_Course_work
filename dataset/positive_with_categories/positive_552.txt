"finally i restaurant in pittsburgh that i can give 4 stars!! mitchell's is located on the waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area. the interior is a classic clean modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood glass etc... the menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  but here's what's great about this place: after 4pm you can get small plates at the bar for $3 each and these ain't no costco fish sticks! two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough french bread they bring out). finally while the drinks aren't cheap they're creative tasty and fresh. all in all i had a great experience and i think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
