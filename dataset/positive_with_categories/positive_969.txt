"whether you live in ben avon heights brighton heights - or anywhere in between - i urge you to try china sea.  it is quite simply the best local chinese delivery.  the people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  the delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  some favorites of ours are the kung pao shrimp pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  i don't mean to compare china sea to the higher end chinese restaurants in our area.  it is not sesame inn or china palace; it is not a date night out sort of place. it most definitely is a cozy inexpensive good quality stay in and relax go to.  hope this helps!  enjoy!psa few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes.ppsalways look at their online coupons you will get something free!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
