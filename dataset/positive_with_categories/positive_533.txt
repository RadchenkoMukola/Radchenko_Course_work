"i've heard a bunch of good things about this place so i decided to make a trip over there on a sunday to check it out. while i enjoyed the coffee and cookies i bought i have to say that everything seems to be a bit overpriced and i did get a feeling of snobbery from some of the staff. however the venue was actually nice with a nice neighborhood feel. every time i have been there since it has been really crowded and i've had trouble finding a seat. i would love to go back in the summer and sit outside at one of the tables.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
