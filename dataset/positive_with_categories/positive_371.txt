"went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! lol. tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don't normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  by the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups we were almost full. love the way their mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. definitely will be back because this place is clean service is quick food is delicious and the price isn't so bad either.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
