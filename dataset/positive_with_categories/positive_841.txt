"my wife and i came here a few years ago and you couldn't get in the door because of the line. this was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. food came out quickly but was not as good as the chinese take out we get from sesame inn. spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. normally one of the great thing about getting chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. i don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on smithfield downtown.the one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. we just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. short of this i'd probably give changs two stars. probably last time i'll stop in here unless i can't get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place i know won't be too busy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
