"my first trip to the east end food co op was sort of a disappointment  i guess i heard so much about it that i sort of made it bigger (in my mind) than it was.first it's not bad for what it is. i like trader joe's better i like whole foods better but this place had stuff i use that the other don't.nice produce section items seemed fresh and plentiful. mostly organic and i do like how they label things local so that we can help our local farmers and growers. great juice bar salad bar and hot lunch items. everything looked appetizing.great spice and herb section i bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas. good vegan section tofurkey brands and lightlife products. good dairy section too their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.that said the east end food co op is a good place to shop for the pantry.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
