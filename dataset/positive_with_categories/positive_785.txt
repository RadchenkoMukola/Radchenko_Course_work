"what an absolutely delightful and special dining experience!  our family of four went there for dinner this past friday night.  brought along  two  bottles of wine which is such a nice bonus. much cheaper and we were able to bring wines that we enjoy.  the decor is lovely very bohemian and cozy.  just magical.  our server was bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  the food is portuguese which is primarily fish based so we ordered accordingly. to start we ordered the cod fritters the grilled octopus and a special salad of the night farm grown tomatoes with roquefort cheese.  all very delicious!  main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous flavor) the impeccable seafood stew and the salmon also lovely.  just a perfect relaxing meal in every way.  if you live in pittsburgh and have not been this place is a gem. worth checking out.  wish we lived closer (we are dc based).",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
