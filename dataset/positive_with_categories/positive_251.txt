"as far as chain restaurants go bar louie is ok. i really like their appetizers and their salads but i don't care for their burgers or pastas. their drinks are ok. they're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e. applebees.service is hit or miss. last time i went i had just fine service. the time before that was also just fine. sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (once i went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. i had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is in fact pink. i still don't think he believed me. it would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying). things i like: calamari pretzel sticks wedge salad some of the sandwiches. things i dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.great to stop in right before a movie at loews though! :-)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
