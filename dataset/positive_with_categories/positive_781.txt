"we stopped by quiet storm for a late lunch while on vacation in pittsburgh.  the food was excellent.  i had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap both were served with chips.  everything was great.  if i had any complaint it would be that i didn't see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it.  i'm not a big fan of it so had i see that i would have asked for it without.  other then that great place!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
