"i am a big fan of rock bottom.there are several dishes that are money.appetizer:  seared ahi spinach artichoke dipentree :      fire steak pub tips or chicken fried chicken.desert :      carrot cake (to die for)bar food:     pizza or ball park pretzels.  both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  half the menu is really good the other half is great.  the beer is good.  ask for the sampler!  they usually have a velvet and something on cask.  ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  they will also have a scotch ale an ipa whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which if its still matt the mood is grumpy).   if andy is still working there he is sure to please and molly is great in the cocktail area.head over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrap.i used to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly can.don't go to the one in charlotte though its not really a rock bottom.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
