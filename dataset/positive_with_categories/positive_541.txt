"ok so i admit that i was underwhelmed by cafe zinho when i first went a few years ago.  and then i didn't go for a long time.  a few months back my husband and i randomly decided to give it another try and boy am i glad we did!  it's fantastic and has quickly become part of our regular line up.i'll say again that i'm not certain how the food is portuguese.  that being said it is mighty delicious.  i love the personal service.  i love the corn bread.  the starters are phenomenal to the point where i sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  but when we get them they are lovely too.  i love the ambiance.  in short i owe cafe zinho an apology.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
