"i am amazed that people can write negative reviews about papa j's.   i have been a return customer since the early 90's and the food quality and service are way above average......and especially for this price range.kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   nothing we had tonight was disappointing and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.the best item tonight was the mozzarella appetizer cradled in bread with an authentic marinara.the white pizza with sun-dried tomatoes was as usual out of this world good.   the scallops special appetizer was phenomenal.we will be back.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
