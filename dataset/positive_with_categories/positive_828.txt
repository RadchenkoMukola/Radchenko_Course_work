"we came here on a saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as i thought it would be. i love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) we only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. i love their new wheel of fortune game! on our first play we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! they also have fruit ninja as a game. it was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. i wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other d&b's i've been to where you feed a counting machine your tickets. at this place they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. we didn't try the food here and instead went to p.f. chang's to eat before coming here but the eat & play deal looked fun. too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. overall i had a blast here and definitely would come back. hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
