"we had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. there was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. as i expected getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. i appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. i still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places but we were satisfied and happy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
