"visited for brunch again on a rainy winter sunday.  i reaffirm my previous comments.good service.  generally great food (the breakfast pastries my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic) however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.while the coffee is great the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  in addition i may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  the lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously this meat is a fork cutting affair.  however the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.as with eleven you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
