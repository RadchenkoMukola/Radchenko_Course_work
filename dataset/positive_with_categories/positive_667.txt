"first off let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. a friend and i went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. the manager tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. this is by far the best dave and busters i've had been to!",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
