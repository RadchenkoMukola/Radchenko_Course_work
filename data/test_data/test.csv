The pizza didn't taste good. It's flavorless, the cheese is tasteless, the sauce and crust are dense... and most importantly, it lacks spices.
Good.
Cozy, always fast and high-quality.
Veksel, fast.
Okay.
The organization of work after quarantine is poorly managed, the staff is rude, they can't explain or communicate well, no menu is provided, the website is not working:/ Haven't experienced such things in a long time. Go, wait, they will come to you... maybe it will be better when they open normally. Ukrainian knowledge is lacking. The pizza is more or less okay, not the best in Kyiv, but decent, but the price is high.
Tasty and soulful.
We love it because they always work diligently, the taste and service are excellent. I recommend it.
Mamamia - probably the best pizza in Kyiv)
Meat Supreme - it's extremely delicious. I recommend it.
